## 4. "Dual Agency: The Hidden Conflict"

- Property: 4BR Valencia home, $1.2M
- Open house: 14 visitors
- Offers received: 3

**Without Mandatory Sign-In (Industry Standard):**
- 14 anonymous visitors walk through
- No records, no contact info
- When 3 offers come in: "Who were those other 11 people?"
- "Should we counter? Or wait for mystery buyers?"
- Result: Accept lower offer, fear of losing deal

**With Mandatory Sign-In (Connor's Standard):**
- All 14 visitors documented with name, email, phone, agent
- Analysis shows:
  - 8 were just curious neighbors
  - 3 were represented by buyers already working with other agents
  - 3 submitted offers (100% conversion of serious buyers!)

- Result: Counter aggressively, sell for $65K over asking
