### **Your Agent Needs to Call Before They Show the Home—Why It’s Crucial for Your Best Interest**

#### **Intro: Trusting Your First Responder Realtor**

Today’s an important day for Santa Clarita residents. It’s voting day, and like you, I took a moment to head to the polls. I’m Connor with Honor, your local expert who brings experience, dedication, and integrity to the Santa Clarita real estate market every day. My goal is simple: to make sure you’re informed and empowered as you navigate buying or selling your home.

#### **The Santa Clarita Market Snapshot**

Every day, I look at a 7-day snapshot of our market to keep you up to speed. This past week in Santa Clarita, here’s what’s new:

	- **Four new “coming soon” listings** are now posted (check them out at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/your-agent-needs-to-call-before-they-show-the-home-for-your-best-interest](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/your-agent-needs-to-call-before-they-show-the-home-for-your-best-interest))

	- **52 new listings** entered the market.

	- **67 properties had price changes**, and **20 came back on the market.**

	- **61 homes closed** over the past seven days.

With this snapshot, you’re seeing the true pulse of the market. Even with shifting national trends, the local Santa Clarita market remains active, albeit slowing down as we near the holiday season. So what’s next?

#### **Why Your Agent Needs to Call Before Showing a Home**

You might wonder: why does it matter if an agent calls before showing a property? Let’s break down the reasons this step is non-negotiable.

	- 
	**Understanding the Seller’s Motivations**

	
		Sellers have various reasons for listing their homes, and it’s crucial to know them. Are they looking for a quick sale due to relocation, or do they need time to buy another property? Knowing these details allows you, the buyer, to strategize with confidence.

	

	
	- 
	**Learning Contingencies Early**

	
		The last thing you want is a surprise contingency. If a seller’s sale is contingent upon their ability to buy, you need to know so you’re not blindsided by potential delays. A simple call to the listing agent can reveal whether this is the case, saving time and stress.

	

	
	- 
	**Verifying Key Property Details**

	
		Is the property vacant or just staged for showings? Maybe the sellers have moved out temporarily to allow for more flexible viewing. Clarifying these details helps avoid assumptions and ensures no surprises.

	

	
	- 
	**Confirming the Commission Structure**

	
		Recent changes in the commission structure nationwide mean that agents may need to verify what the listing agent is offering to the buyer’s agent. This is a nuanced part of the process, particularly after the recent settlements impacting brokerages, so don’t skip this detail.

	

	

#### **Communication is the Foundation of Real Estate Success**

Calling the listing agent isn’t just a formality; it’s a proactive way to ensure the smoothest transaction possible.

	- 
	**Motivations and Deal Contingencies**: Agents can uncover important elements like whether a property sale is contingent on the seller’s ability to buy. You want to be fully informed to avoid disappointments and wasted time.

	

	- 
	**Keeping the Buyer Informed**: A good agent is always in the know, and that requires reaching out to understand the property’s real status and avoiding miscommunications. As a buyer, you want the confidence of knowing your agent is fully informed and equipped to negotiate effectively.

	

#### **National Real Estate Trends Affecting Santa Clarita**

The national real estate landscape is evolving, and Santa Clarita isn’t immune. Here’s how broader market shifts impact us locally:

	- 
	**First-Time Homebuyers at Historic Lows**

	
		The National Association of Realtors reports that first-time buyers make up only 24% of the market, the lowest in 43 years. High prices and interest rates are barriers, but in Santa Clarita, demand remains strong. Buyers who are repeat homeowners continue to keep the market competitive, even with fewer first-time buyers.

	

	
	- 
	**Antitrust Settlements and Commission Structures**

	
		Recent antitrust settlements are reshaping commission structures. Here in Santa Clarita, this doesn’t affect sales directly, but it may influence how clients perceive the value of real estate services and could affect commission negotiations.

	

	
	- 
	**Insurance Costs Are Rising Nationwide**

	
		With increased premiums in disaster-prone areas, insurance is a top consideration. For Santa Clarita, where wildfire risk is real, this adds another layer of cost. Working with knowledgeable agents who understand local insurance challenges is invaluable.

	

	
	- 
	**Inventory Still Constrained Despite Demand**

	
		While buyers remain active, inventory is still low nationwide. Santa Clarita sees similar challenges, especially in high-demand price points. This limited inventory affects pricing and makes strategic buying and selling all the more critical.

	

	

#### **Rising Insurance Costs Impacting Santa Clarita Buyers**

Home insurance has become a major talking point, with surging costs particularly in areas prone to natural disasters. In California, wildfire risks make certain areas more expensive to insure, and some companies are even pulling out of the state.

With fewer providers in the market, insurance premiums are higher than ever. This is where having a connected agent comes into play—an agent who knows which areas face the highest premiums and has reliable contacts to secure the best coverage for clients. Insurances affect home affordability, and without the right plan, some buyers could find themselves priced out.

#### **What You Should Know as a Seller**

If you’re listing your property, know that agents will reach out to verify key details. Any successful sale involves transparency, clear communication, and aligning expectations. Agents worth their salt will ask questions about your timeline, any sale contingencies, and commission structures.

	- **Stand Out by Being Ready to Communicate**: Sellers who are prepared to answer these questions help streamline the process, making their homes more appealing.

	- **Understand the Importance of Your Online Presence**: From Zillow to SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com, online exposure is essential. Ensure your agent is taking full advantage of all the platforms to reach a wide audience.

#### **Leveraging Technology for Informed Decisions**

Real estate technology, including artificial intelligence, is increasingly shaping how we buy and sell. From property valuation tools to predictive analytics, understanding the tech available to us allows for more accurate and strategic decision-making.

AI, for example, can aid in pricing predictions, which is valuable in Santa Clarita’s competitive market. Buyers and sellers alike should be aware of the advancements and leverage an agent who understands this landscape.

#### **Closing Thoughts: Hire a First Responder Realtor You Can Trust**

Navigating today’s real estate landscape requires more than just basic market knowledge. In a field full of quick turnarounds and shifting trends, having a first-responder realtor like myself—someone who has built a career on trust, responsiveness, and diligence—makes all the difference.

Whether you’re buying, selling, or investing, I’m here to ensure you’re equipped with the best information to make confident decisions in the Santa Clarita market.
