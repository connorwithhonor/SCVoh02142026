### **Your Agent Needs to Call Before They Show the Home—Why It’s Crucial for Your Best Interest**

#### **Intro: Trusting Your First Responder Realtor**

Today’s an important day for Santa Clarita residents. It’s voting day, and like you, I took a moment to head to the polls. I’m Connor with Honor, your local expert who brings experience, dedication, and integrity to the Santa Clarita real estate market every day. My goal is simple: to make sure you’re informed and empowered as you navigate buying or selling your home.

#### **The Santa Clarita Market Snapshot**

Every day, I look at a 7-day snapshot of our market to keep you up to speed. This past week in Santa Clarita, here’s what’s new:

With this snapshot, you’re seeing the true pulse of the market. Even with shifting national trends, the local Santa Clarita market remains active, albeit slowing down as we near the holiday season. So what’s next?

#### **Why Your Agent Needs to Call Before Showing a Home**

You might wonder: why does it matter if an agent calls before showing a property? Let’s break down the reasons this step is non-negotiable.

#### **Communication is the Foundation of Real Estate Success**

Calling the listing agent isn’t just a formality; it’s a proactive way to ensure the smoothest transaction possible.

#### **National Real Estate Trends Affecting Santa Clarita**

The national real estate landscape is evolving, and Santa Clarita isn’t immune. Here’s how broader market shifts impact us locally:

#### **Rising Insurance Costs Impacting Santa Clarita Buyers**

Home insurance has become a major talking point, with surging costs particularly in areas prone to natural disasters. In California, wildfire risks make certain areas more expensive to insure, and some companies are even pulling out of the state.

With fewer providers in the market, insurance premiums are higher than ever. This is where having a connected agent comes into play—an agent who knows which areas face the highest premiums and has reliable contacts to secure the best coverage for clients. Insurances affect home affordability, and without the right plan, some buyers could find themselves priced out.

#### **What You Should Know as a Seller**

If you’re listing your property, know that agents will reach out to verify key details. Any successful sale involves transparency, clear communication, and aligning expectations. Agents worth their salt will ask questions about your timeline, any sale contingencies, and commission structures.

#### **Leveraging Technology for Informed Decisions**

Real estate technology, including artificial intelligence, is increasingly shaping how we buy and sell. From property valuation tools to predictive analytics, understanding the tech available to us allows for more accurate and strategic decision-making.

AI, for example, can aid in pricing predictions, which is valuable in Santa Clarita’s competitive market. Buyers and sellers alike should be aware of the advancements and leverage an agent who understands this landscape.

#### **Closing Thoughts: Hire a First Responder Realtor You Can Trust**

Navigating today’s real estate landscape requires more than just basic market knowledge. In a field full of quick turnarounds and shifting trends, having a first-responder realtor like myself—someone who has built a career on trust, responsiveness, and diligence—makes all the difference.

Whether you’re buying, selling, or investing, I’m here to ensure you’re equipped with the best information to make confident decisions in the Santa Clarita market.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
