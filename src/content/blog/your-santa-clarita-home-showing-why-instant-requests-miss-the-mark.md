# Your Santa Clarita Home Showing: Why Instant Requests Miss the Mark

Connor "with Honor" MacIvor - June 17, 2025** [0 Comments](/#comments) | [Add Comment](/#add-comment)

As Connor MacIvor, also known as Connor with Honor, a full-time Realtor and a retired LAPD officer, I bring a unique perspective to the real estate market in Santa Clarita and Southern California. My website, SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com, is dedicated to helping clients navigate this market effectively. Today, I want to share some insights, particularly for new real estate agents, but also for buyers and sellers, about the dynamics of showing occupied homes.

### The Importance of Prepared Showings

When an agent has a listing, and they have it on the multiple listing service, there's a particular amount of time in which to have the listing scheduled to be shown. This isn't just a formality; it's crucial for the seller to present their home in the best possible light. Think of it like preparing for a date:

	- **Presentation Matters:** Sellers need time to prepare the house, ensuring it's in a great semblance of shape, clean, and all clutter put away.

	- **Setting the Atmosphere:** They want it to be either cool or warm, depending on the season, have all the lights on, and perhaps some ambiance created with soft jazz music.

	- **Cooperation is Key:** For tenant-occupied properties, a good relationship with the tenant is vital to ensure they cooperate with showing requests, often needing a couple of hours' notice.

This preparation is paramount because a well-presented home significantly impacts a buyer's first impression and overall perception of the property's value. A rushed, unprepared showing can detract from the home's appeal, potentially leading to lower offers or a longer time on the market. Every detail, from a freshly vacuumed carpet to adequate lighting, contributes to creating an inviting atmosphere that encourages buyers to envision themselves living there. It's about showcasing not just the structure, but the lifestyle the home offers.

### Understanding Last-Minute Showing Requests

Newer agents, in particular, might encounter text messages from other agents requesting to see a house within 10 to 15 minutes, or stating they are "in the neighborhood" and their buyer wants to see the house. From my experience, these last-minute requests often indicate one of two things:

	- **Lack of Preparation:** The agent making the request may not have done their homework or prepared the day before.

	- **Mismatched Criteria:** The home might not actually fit the buyer's criteria. Maybe they're only looking at four-bedroom homes and the one listed is three bedrooms. Perhaps the property is above or below their price point. It's difficult to imagine an agent intentionally cutting off a client's bottom price point, but it's a possibility.

It's important for sellers and their agents not to lose sleep over not being able to accommodate these immediate requests because those who want to see it within a few minutes weren't prepared in the first place. These instances are usually due to the unpreparedness of the other agent or a fundamental mismatch in property criteria. What are the odds of them really loving it if it's missing a critical component? A very small percentage of these actually work out.

This common scenario highlights a fundamental difference in approach. Professional real estate agents, like myself, emphasize meticulous planning to maximize efficiency and effectiveness. When an agent consistently makes last-minute demands, it signals a disorganized workflow that could ultimately disservice their own clients. It also puts undue pressure on the listing agent and the seller, disrupting their schedules and potentially compromising the quality of the showing. Furthermore, it can be a red flag that the agent might not fully understand their buyer's needs or is simply using a scattergun approach, hoping something sticks. For buyers, this means they might be seeing homes that are not truly aligned with their desires, leading to wasted time and frustration.

### Advising Your Clients on Showings

When working with buyers, I always explain that we prepare our showing schedule the day before. If a property comes up spontaneously while driving around that wasn't on the list, it's typically because it didn't meet their initial search criteria. I then quickly verify the details and inform them so they understand exactly what that is. I also inform them that the multiple listing service states it requires one to two hours' notice, and while we're in front of it now, we can look at other properties and come back later, or I will try to schedule it now. In all these cases, it's not something the seller or their agent didn't do. This just happens to be one of those people who are unprepared.

For sellers, it’s vital to communicate these dynamics so they understand the method behind showing scheduling and don't think it's something you're doing wrong. Transparency builds trust and manages expectations. If a buyer is genuinely interested and the property is a good fit, they will typically respect the showing protocols. My commitment to my clients is to be the most prepared and effective agent possible, ensuring that every showing is a productive step towards achieving their real estate goals. This detailed approach is what sets First Responder Realtor apart in the Santa Clarita and Southern California markets.

### The Real Estate Agent's Role: Beyond Just Opening Doors

Being a successful real estate agent involves much more than simply opening doors for showings. It requires a deep understanding of market dynamics, meticulous planning, strong negotiation skills, and a commitment to client education. As a First Responder Realtor, I emphasize these aspects, drawing on my LAPD background to bring a unique blend of discipline, strategic thinking, and dedication to every transaction.

#### Strategic Planning for Sellers

For sellers, strategic planning begins long before the "For Sale" sign goes up. It involves:

	- **Comprehensive Market Analysis:** Understanding the current market conditions in Santa Clarita is crucial. This includes analyzing comparable sales, active listings, and absorption rates. My market reports, such as the "Santa Clarita Real Estate Full Market Recap for Q1 2025" and the "Santa Clarita Real Estate April 2025: Where is the Market and Where Are We Going?", provide valuable insights into these trends.

	- **Optimal Pricing Strategy:** Pricing a home correctly from the outset is paramount. Overpricing can lead to a property sitting on the market, requiring frustrating price reductions. Underpricing leaves money on the table. My goal is to help sellers understand "What Your Santa Clarita Home is Worth in 2025" and implement a pricing strategy that attracts serious buyers and maximizes their return.

	- **Home Preparation and Staging:** As discussed, preparing the home for showings is critical. This might involve decluttering, minor repairs, and professional staging. My "How to Prepare Your Home for an Open House in Santa Clarita" guide offers practical advice.

	- **Effective Marketing:** Beyond the MLS, effective marketing involves high-quality photography, virtual tours, targeted online advertising, and leveraging social media. I ensure listings, whether it's "27931 Balsam Court, Valencia, CA 91354" or "22206 Claibourne Lane, Saugus, CA 91350", reach a wide audience.

	- **Managing Showings and Feedback:** Efficiently managing showing appointments and gathering feedback from prospective buyers and their agents is essential. This feedback provides valuable insights into how the market perceives the property and what adjustments, if any, might be needed.

	- **Negotiation Expertise:** My experience as a retired LAPD officer has honed my negotiation skills, which are invaluable when it comes to "How to Handle Multiple Offers and Get the Best Deal When Selling Your SCV Home". I strive to ensure my clients get the "highest price in the shortest time".

#### Empowering Buyers with Information and Strategy

For buyers, my role is to equip them with the knowledge and strategy needed to make informed decisions in a competitive market.

	- **Getting Pre-Approved:** The first step for any serious buyer is to get pre-approved for a mortgage. This clarifies their budget and demonstrates their seriousness to sellers. I guide clients through understanding mortgage rates, loan types, and even programs like "100 Percent Financing on Santa Clarita Real Estate with the MyAccess Program" or "Zero Down Home Loans for 2025".

	- **Understanding the Market:** Buyers need to understand whether they are entering a "hot, normal, or cold market". My market updates, like "Santa Clarita Market Update: Surging Inventory and Fresh Buyer Demand", keep clients informed.

	- **Targeted Home Search:** Utilizing advanced search tools, buyers can quickly find homes that meet their specific criteria, whether it's "Homes with a Pool for Sale in Santa Clarita Valley, CA", "Homes in a 55+ Community", or properties near specific high schools like Saugus High School.

	- **Due Diligence:** From property inspections to understanding environmental issues or potential lead poisoning, thorough due diligence is non-negotiable. I stress the importance of a home inspection and understanding preliminary reports and title insurance.

	- **Strategic Offer Submission:** In today's market, making a strong and informed offer is crucial. I educate buyers on the residential purchase agreement and the importance of having a written buyer agreement.

	- **Navigating the Closing Process:** From escrow functions to understanding required IRS reporting, I guide buyers through every step of the closing process.

### The AI Frontier in Real Estate and Beyond

My passion extends beyond traditional real estate into the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence. I am actively involved in "AI with Honor" and "AIforAgentsOrg", focusing on implementing and integrating AI into real estate agents' businesses, brokerages, and other businesses. AI is revolutionizing how we search for homes, analyze market data, and even personalize client experiences.

	- **AI-Powered Market Insights:** AI can process vast amounts of real estate data to identify trends, predict market shifts, and even assist in home pricing. This means more accurate "Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Reports" and deeper insights into specific communities like Acton, Agua Dulce, Canyon Country, Castaic, Chatsworth, Granada Hills, Moorpark, Newhall, Northridge, Porter Ranch, Saugus, Simi Valley, Stevenson Ranch, Sylmar, and Ventura.

	- **Enhanced Client Experience:** AI can help personalize home searches, recommend properties based on detailed preferences, and even streamline communication. My "AI-Enhanced Learning Verification Tool" is an example of how I'm exploring these possibilities.

	- **Operational Efficiency for Agents:** AI tools can automate repetitive tasks, allowing agents to focus more on client relationships and complex negotiations. I share my "Ultimate Agent AI Tools List" to help other real estate professionals integrate AI into their workflows.

However, I also advocate for "AI Ethics and Necessity", emphasizing that while AI is a powerful tool, human intelligence, integrity, and ethical considerations must always be at the forefront. As I've explored in my blog post, "Don't Trust AI When It Comes to Market Opinions in Santa Clarita Real Estate", human judgment and experience remain irreplaceable. I believe in a future where AI augments human capabilities, rather than replacing them, especially in a relationship-driven industry like real estate.

### My Personal Journey: From LAPD to Real Estate and Wellness

My journey from 17 years as an LAPD officer (and 5 as a reserve) to a full-time Realtor is foundational to my approach. This background instilled in me a deep understanding of service, negotiation, and resilience. I've been to hostage negotiator school, which directly translates to my ability to "hire a strong negotiator in Santa Clarita real estate" for my clients. This unique experience allows me to "add value to the home buyer experience one honest sale at a time".

Beyond my real estate career, I am passionately dedicated to health and fitness. My personal transformation, dropping 135 pounds of fat in about 7.5 months through intermittent fasting and testosterone therapy, is a testament to my belief in self-improvement and dedication. This journey, which I share on @Homemuscle and @FastingwithHonor, underscores my commitment to living with "honor" in all aspects of life. I believe that it's "easier to be fit and depressed than fat and depressed", and that "no one is coming to save you but you can save yourself". These principles of self-reliance and continuous improvement guide my professional and personal endeavors.

My experiences in law enforcement taught me to be observant, analytical, and always prepared. This translates directly into how I represent my clients. For instance, I know the importance of "knowing which homes are priced to sell" and understanding the subtle cues in negotiations. I don't just "show their strength" as an agent; I apply real-world skills to protect my clients' interests.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
