# Your Santa Clarita Home Showing: Why Instant Requests Miss the Mark

Connor "with Honor" MacIvor - June 17, 2025** [0 Comments](/#comments) | [Add Comment](/#add-comment)

As Connor MacIvor, also known as Connor with Honor, a full-time Realtor and a retired LAPD officer, I bring a unique perspective to the real estate market in Santa Clarita and Southern California. My website, SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com, is dedicated to helping clients navigate this market effectively. Today, I want to share some insights, particularly for new real estate agents, but also for buyers and sellers, about the dynamics of showing occupied homes.

### The Importance of Prepared Showings

When an agent has a listing, and they have it on the multiple listing service, there's a particular amount of time in which to have the listing scheduled to be shown. This isn't just a formality; it's crucial for the seller to present their home in the best possible light. Think of it like preparing for a date:

This preparation is paramount because a well-presented home significantly impacts a buyer's first impression and overall perception of the property's value. A rushed, unprepared showing can detract from the home's appeal, potentially leading to lower offers or a longer time on the market. Every detail, from a freshly vacuumed carpet to adequate lighting, contributes to creating an inviting atmosphere that encourages buyers to envision themselves living there. It's about showcasing not just the structure, but the lifestyle the home offers.

### Understanding Last-Minute Showing Requests

Newer agents, in particular, might encounter text messages from other agents requesting to see a house within 10 to 15 minutes, or stating they are "in the neighborhood" and their buyer wants to see the house. From my experience, these last-minute requests often indicate one of two things:

It's important for sellers and their agents not to lose sleep over not being able to accommodate these immediate requests because those who want to see it within a few minutes weren't prepared in the first place. These instances are usually due to the unpreparedness of the other agent or a fundamental mismatch in property criteria. What are the odds of them really loving it if it's missing a critical component? A very small percentage of these actually work out.

This common scenario highlights a fundamental difference in approach. Professional real estate agents, like myself, emphasize meticulous planning to maximize efficiency and effectiveness. When an agent consistently makes last-minute demands, it signals a disorganized workflow that could ultimately disservice their own clients. It also puts undue pressure on the listing agent and the seller, disrupting their schedules and potentially compromising the quality of the showing. Furthermore, it can be a red flag that the agent might not fully understand their buyer's needs or is simply using a scattergun approach, hoping something sticks. For buyers, this means they might be seeing homes that are not truly aligned with their desires, leading to wasted time and frustration.

### Advising Your Clients on Showings

When working with buyers, I always explain that we prepare our showing schedule the day before. If a property comes up spontaneously while driving around that wasn't on the list, it's typically because it didn't meet their initial search criteria. I then quickly verify the details and inform them so they understand exactly what that is. I also inform them that the multiple listing service states it requires one to two hours' notice, and while we're in front of it now, we can look at other properties and come back later, or I will try to schedule it now. In all these cases, it's not something the seller or their agent didn't do. This just happens to be one of those people who are unprepared.

For sellers, it’s vital to communicate these dynamics so they understand the method behind showing scheduling and don't think it's something you're doing wrong. Transparency builds trust and manages expectations. If a buyer is genuinely interested and the property is a good fit, they will typically respect the showing protocols. My commitment to my clients is to be the most prepared and effective agent possible, ensuring that every showing is a productive step towards achieving their real estate goals. This detailed approach is what sets First Responder Realtor apart in the Santa Clarita and Southern California markets.

### The Real Estate Agent's Role: Beyond Just Opening Doors

Being a successful real estate agent involves much more than simply opening doors for showings. It requires a deep understanding of market dynamics, meticulous planning, strong negotiation skills, and a commitment to client education. As a First Responder Realtor, I emphasize these aspects, drawing on my LAPD background to bring a unique blend of discipline, strategic thinking, and dedication to every transaction.

#### Strategic Planning for Sellers

For sellers, strategic planning begins long before the "For Sale" sign goes up. It involves:

#### Empowering Buyers with Information and Strategy

For buyers, my role is to equip them with the knowledge and strategy needed to make informed decisions in a competitive market.

### The AI Frontier in Real Estate and Beyond

My passion extends beyond traditional real estate into the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence. I am actively involved in "AI with Honor" and "AIforAgentsOrg", focusing on implementing and integrating AI into real estate agents' businesses, brokerages, and other businesses. AI is revolutionizing how we search for homes, analyze market data, and even personalize client experiences.

However, I also advocate for "AI Ethics and Necessity", emphasizing that while AI is a powerful tool, human intelligence, integrity, and ethical considerations must always be at the forefront. As I've explored in my blog post, "Don't Trust AI When It Comes to Market Opinions in Santa Clarita Real Estate", human judgment and experience remain irreplaceable. I believe in a future where AI augments human capabilities, rather than replacing them, especially in a relationship-driven industry like real estate.

### My Personal Journey: From LAPD to Real Estate and Wellness

My journey from 17 years as an LAPD officer (and 5 as a reserve) to a full-time Realtor is foundational to my approach. This background instilled in me a deep understanding of service, negotiation, and resilience. I've been to hostage negotiator school, which directly translates to my ability to "hire a strong negotiator in Santa Clarita real estate" for my clients. This unique experience allows me to "add value to the home buyer experience one honest sale at a time".

Beyond my real estate career, I am passionately dedicated to health and fitness. My personal transformation, dropping 135 pounds of fat in about 7.5 months through intermittent fasting and testosterone therapy, is a testament to my belief in self-improvement and dedication. This journey, which I share on @Homemuscle and @FastingwithHonor, underscores my commitment to living with "honor" in all aspects of life. I believe that it's "easier to be fit and depressed than fat and depressed", and that "no one is coming to save you but you can save yourself". These principles of self-reliance and continuous improvement guide my professional and personal endeavors.

My experiences in law enforcement taught me to be observant, analytical, and always prepared. This translates directly into how I represent my clients. For instance, I know the importance of "knowing which homes are priced to sell" and understanding the subtle cues in negotiations. I don't just "show their strength" as an agent; I apply real-world skills to protect my clients' interests.
