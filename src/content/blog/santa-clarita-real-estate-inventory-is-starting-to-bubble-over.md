Welcome to the Daily Santa Clarita Real Estate Show, proudly sponsored by [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](http://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com) and presented by Connor with Honor. Today, we have some groundbreaking updates that every buyer and seller in Santa Clarita needs to know about. So, let’s dive in!

**Market Watch Update:**

The Santa Clarita real estate market has hit a significant milestone, with active listings reaching 464—the highest number since June 2021. This surge in inventory provides a unique opportunity for both buyers and sellers to navigate the market strategically. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the current market status:

	- **Coming Soon:** 10 properties

	- **New Listings:** 87 properties

	- **Price Changes:** 64 properties

	- **Back On Market:** 15 properties

	- **Active Under Contract:** 31 properties

	- **Pending:** 40 properties

	- **Closed:** 48 properties

	- **Expired:** 4 properties

	- **Canceled:** 11 properties

	- **Hold:** 10 properties

	- **Withdrawn:** 2 properties

### Expert Tips for Sellers:

**1. Make Your Property Stand Out:** In a market with increasing inventory, it's crucial to make your property as appealing as possible. Consider professional staging, high-quality photography, and minor renovations to attract potential buyers.

**2. Pricing Strategies:** Setting the right price for your home is more important than ever. Overpricing can lead to extended days on market, which can deter buyers. Work with a real estate professional to determine a competitive and attractive price for your property.

**3. Monitor Market Trends:** Stay informed about the latest market trends and adjust your selling strategy accordingly. Understanding buyer behavior and preferences can help you make informed decisions about listing your property.

### Key Insights for Buyers:

**1. Increased Inventory:** With a higher number of active listings, buyers now have a wider selection of homes to choose from. This is an excellent time to find a property that fits your specific needs and budget.

**2. Negotiation Power:** In a market with abundant inventory, buyers often have more leverage in negotiations. Don't hesitate to negotiate terms, ask for concessions, or request repairs during the inspection period.

**3. Interest Rates:** Keep an eye on current mortgage rates. Even a small change in interest rates can significantly impact your monthly payments. Work with a mortgage advisor to lock in the best rate possible.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
