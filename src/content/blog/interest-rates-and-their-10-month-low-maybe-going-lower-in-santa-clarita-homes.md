# Interest Rates and their 10 month low maybe going lower in Santa Clarita homes

**INTRODUCTION**
No fluffy intros—just an authority tone that cuts to the chase:
Today’s real estate headlines offer a crystal-clear roadmap for anyone looking to buy, sell, or invest in Santa Clarita right now. From shifting new home trends to slowing sales and rising construction, every signal spells opportunity—and I'm here to show you exactly how to seize it.

#### 1. **New‐Home Sales Slide—Santa Clarita’s Hidden Advantage**

Nationally, newly built home sales fell 8.2% in July compared to a year ago, even though builders boosted incentives—yet the fastest sales are for homes priced under $300K&nbsp;

In Santa Clarita, new-construction inventory often targets higher price tiers—meaning that if you're a buyer, you could now negotiate more easily or find “hidden gems” in earlier phases many might overlook. If you're a seller positioning a new-build listing, it’s time to highlight compelling incentives or creative financing to compete.

#### 2. **Slowing Home Sales—Why That Translates to Buyer Power**

Across the U.S., homes are taking longer to sell, with inventory hitting its highest levels since spring 2020.&nbsp;In July, 27.4% of homes saw price cuts, and inventory surged 15.7%.

That’s your leverage. In Santa Clarita, slower-moving listings open the door for savvy buyers to make low‑effort, high‑reward offers—especially when guided by a pro who understands timing and pricing. For sellers, strategic staging, refreshed marketing, and smart pricing tactics wield more influence than ever.

#### 3. **Tech Innovations at Realtor.com—Access You Can’t Afford to Ignore**

Realtor.com has invested heavily in technology, ushering in a new CTO to “accelerate innovation”. This means your coming‑soon listings and off‑market properties can reach highly targeted buyers faster and smarter. I have adopted similar changes to SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com&nbsp;without being concerned with ad revenue. I wanted to build and maintain a local real estate website that does not force registration to get real estate listings directly from the Multiple Listing service, and which isn't loaded with ADS from other real estate related vendors.

I wanted my clients to have a place they would go without being sold and to find the best information pertaining to the Santa Clarita real estate market.

As Connor with Honor, you can tap into these advanced tools to deliver exclusive previews, insider alerts, and personalized match‑making before listings hit the MLS. Ask me how we make the tech work for you—not just today, but every day.

**CALL-TO-ACTION REMINDER #1:**
**Unlock exclusive access** to my **coming soon listings before they hit the market** at [https://SantaClaritaComingSoon.com](https://SantaClaritaComingSoon.com). Be the first in, every time.

#### 4. **Mortgage Rate Watch—Cooler Markets, Cooler Rates**

Mortgage rates have driven many buyers to pause—yet recent data shows rates holding steady at 10‑month lows. For local buyers, that’s opportunity. For sellers, it's the moment to make affordability part of your narrative—with pro tips, financing alternatives, and urgency framing.

#### 5. **What Today’s Market Means for Santa Clarita Sellers**

	- 
	**Longer days on market?** Position your listing to stand out—virtual tours, video walkthroughs, and fresh visuals.

	

	- 
	**High inventory?** Use targeted messaging—highlight neighborhood features, schools, lifestyle.

	

	- 
	**Favorable rates?** Highlight how a buyer’s monthly payment now compares to renting or waiting—create that emotional connection. Need help implementing? Let’s strategize.

	

**CALL-TO-ACTION REMINDER #2:**

#### 6. **Why Santa Clarita Still Holds Strong—Balanced Growth Meets Lifestyle Appeal**

Santa Clarita offers a rare blend of affordability, accessibility, and lifestyle. While much of the region grapples with inventory crunch or slow demand, SCV benefits from new buyers relocating for space, schools, and value.

I monitor daily shifts, so you stay ahead.

**CALL-TO-ACTION REMINDER #3:**
Each day, I publish the **top-performing Santa Clarita real estate update** at [https://SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com). Bookmark it today—your daily advantage starts there.

Every day, the headlines scream a new narrative about the housing market. You read about a national slowdown, the impact of high interest rates, and a looming correction. The sheer volume of this information, often presented with a sense of impending crisis, can be overwhelming. It can make a potential buyer feel like the dream of homeownership is out of reach and a homeowner feel as though their most valuable asset is at risk. But here in Santa Clarita, our story is fundamentally different.

The national narrative is a broad brushstroke, a generalization that fails to account for the unique, localized dynamics of a market like ours. My decades of experience in this valley, first as a decorated LAPD officer and now as a full-time Realtor, have taught me one undeniable truth: real estate is always local. What's happening in Boise, Idaho, or Austin, Texas, is not what is happening in Valencia, Saugus, or Canyon Country. Our market operates on its own set of rules, driven by our unique economy, our community values, and our unwavering desirability as a place to live.

This is my deep dive, my analysis of the real estate landscape as it pertains to us, here at home. I am not going to regurgitate headlines. I am going to give you an unfiltered, no-nonsense look at what is truly happening on the ground, and more importantly, how you can strategically navigate it to achieve your goals, whether you are a buyer or a seller. The national conversation is a distraction from the powerful opportunities right here in our backyard.

### The Myth of the Interest Rate Crash and the Reality of Buyer Psychology

The most dominant story of the last two years has been the dramatic increase in mortgage rates. The talking heads on the news and the blog posts online have sensationalized this, painting a picture of a paralyzed market. They are right that higher rates have increased the cost of borrowing and put downward pressure on affordability. However, what they completely miss is the powerful, psychological shift this has created in our market and the strategic opportunities that have been created as a direct result.

When rates were at historical lows, the market was a frenzy. Buyers were in a state of desperation, a feeding frenzy that led to bidding wars, waived contingencies, and home prices that felt completely disconnected from reality. It was a race to the bottom, where the fastest offer, regardless of its quality, often won. This was not a healthy market. It was a chaotic, unsustainable environment that rewarded impulse over strategy.

Now, with rates stabilized at a higher level, that frenetic energy has dissipated. This is not a bad thing. In fact, it is the best thing that could have happened for serious, prepared buyers. The casual buyers who were simply "looking" have been sidelined. This has thinned the herd, reducing the competition and allowing me to work with committed, focused clients who are ready to make a thoughtful, strategic move.

The higher rates have forced a return to sound financial principles. It's no longer about getting the lowest possible interest rate, but about getting the best overall deal on a home. A higher interest rate on a great price is often a better long-term financial play than a rock-bottom rate on a grossly inflated price. This is where my expertise comes into play. I guide my clients through strategies like seller-paid buydowns, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) for short-term savings, or simply finding a property with a price point that makes the monthly payment manageable. This is a thinking person’s market, not a reactive one. The buyers who are winning today are not just the ones with the deepest pockets; they are the ones with the smartest strategy.

For sellers, this new reality is also an opportunity. It means the market has normalized. The days of putting a sign in the yard and having 20 offers in 24 hours are over. But what has replaced it is a more stable, predictable market where a properly priced, well-marketed home still sells for a premium. The key is understanding that your marketing and presentation have never been more important. You can no longer rely on market momentum to do the heavy lifting for you. You need a comprehensive, aggressive marketing strategy that highlights your home's unique value and reaches the right, committed buyers. The sellers who are getting top dollar right now are those who understand the market is more about precision than power.

### The Inventory Conundrum: A Story of Nuance, Not Scarcity

National news often highlights the tight inventory of homes for sale. This is true, but the reason *why* is often overlooked, and the solution it presents is completely different in our local market. The primary cause of low inventory is not a lack of people who want to sell. It is a phenomenon I call "golden handcuffs." Many homeowners are locked into mortgage rates of 2% or 3% from just a few years ago. The thought of selling their current home and buying a new one at a 7% or 8% mortgage rate is financially daunting, even if they could afford the higher payment. This has created a significant disincentive for homeowners to move.

But here in Santa Clarita, we are seeing a gradual and powerful shift. While the overall inventory remains lower than the pre-pandemic norm, it has been steadily increasing. My on-the-ground analysis shows more homes coming to market, and this is creating a subtle but important change in the balance of power. We have seen a notable increase in active listings across all of our neighborhoods, from the master-planned communities of Valencia to the spacious ranches in Canyon Country. This means buyers have more choices, and the pressure of a desperate bidding war is less likely to occur. It also means that sellers who enter the market now have an opportunity to capitalize on this increased buyer pool, which is still contending with a limited number of great homes for sale.

This is a critical moment for both parties. For a buyer, this is your chance to find a home you love without the intense competition of the past. You can take your time, conduct proper inspections, and make a strong, conditional offer. For a seller, this is your opportunity to list before a potential flood of new inventory hits the market, giving your home the spotlight it deserves. The sellers who will win in this environment are those who understand that being first to market with a compelling offer is a massive strategic advantage.

The real story of inventory in Santa Clarita is not about scarcity; it is about selection. The best homes, the ones that are priced correctly and marketed intelligently, are still selling quickly. But the average or overpriced homes are sitting on the market longer, and they are seeing price reductions. This is the market rebalancing itself, rewarding strategic thinking and penalizing those who cling to outdated, pre-frenzy market expectations. My job is to ensure you are on the winning side of this equation, whether you are buying or selling.

### Home Prices: The Stability of an Elite Market

The media loves to sensationalize home prices, often focusing on national dips or plateaus. But once again, this doesn't capture the true health of the Santa Clarita market. My research shows that the median home price in Santa Clarita has not only remained resilient, but in many cases, has continued to appreciate.

This stability is not an accident. It is a direct result of the core value proposition of our community. Santa Clarita offers a unique blend of suburban tranquility, top-tier schools, and a family-friendly atmosphere, all within a reasonable commute to the economic and cultural hub of Los Angeles. We are a destination market for families, professionals, and anyone seeking a high quality of life. This unwavering demand acts as a powerful insulator against the volatility seen in other parts of the country.

My data shows that home values have continued their upward trajectory, albeit at a more sustainable pace. In neighborhoods like Valencia, which are known for their amenities, and in Newhall, with its revitalization and charm, we are seeing consistent price appreciation. Even in more affordable pockets like Canyon Country, home values are holding firm. The key takeaway is that your investment in a Santa Clarita home is not just an asset; it is a long-term hedge against the very economic pressures the headlines are so fond of sensationalizing.

Furthermore, our market is not just driven by local demand. We are seeing a powerful influx of buyers from other parts of California and the country, who are fleeing dense urban areas in search of more space, better schools, and a safer community. These buyers are often armed with significant equity from the sale of their previous homes, which injects a powerful source of capital into our market. This demographic shift provides a foundational layer of demand that will continue to support our home values for years to come.

My analysis of the sale-to-list price ratios and days on market tells a powerful story. Homes are selling, and they are selling for close to their asking price. The median days on market has increased, but this is a sign of a healthier, more balanced market, not a failing one. It means buyers can take a breath, and sellers who put the time and effort into their marketing and pricing are being rewarded.

### The Path Forward: Your Personalized Strategy

A general market overview, even one as detailed as this, can only get you so far. It can’t analyze your specific situation. It can't tell you the optimal time to sell your home based on the competition in your neighborhood. It can't help you find an off-market opportunity that perfectly fits your family’s needs. That’s where a generic online search or a national news report completely falls short.

This is a market that requires a strategic partner, a local expert who understands the unique subtleties of every street and every neighborhood. The national headlines are designed to create a sense of panic and uncertainty. My goal is to do the opposite: to empower you with clarity, confidence, and a winning strategy.

I have spent my career preparing for this moment. As an LAPD officer, my training was to analyze complex situations, identify threats and opportunities, and develop a precise plan of action. I bring that same discipline, that same level of detail-oriented strategic thinking, to every single one of my real estate clients. I don't believe in a one-size-fits-all approach. I believe in sitting down with you, listening to your goals, and creating a personalized roadmap that navigates the current market and puts you in a position of power.

This is a market that rewards those who are armed with the right information and the right strategy. The key to winning in this environment is getting ahead of the curve. You need to know about the listings before they are even public. You need to have a conversation about your real estate plans with someone who understands the local dynamics better than anyone else.

That's why I am making two critical resources available to you right now. First, I am giving you exclusive access to my curated list of coming soon listings. These are homes that are not yet on the public market, but are being prepared for sale. By getting access to these listings, you can get a jump on the competition and find your perfect home before anyone else even knows it’s available. You can access this exclusive list and get more information on them by visiting https://santaclaritacomingsoon.com.

Second, I am offering a free, private Zoom meeting with me. This isn't a sales pitch. This is a one-on-one, confidential consultation where you can share your real estate goals, and I can give you my unfiltered, expert analysis on the best strategies to put into place. Whether you are thinking of buying, selling, or just want to understand the true value of your home, this is your opportunity to get a personalized roadmap from a local expert who has your best interests at heart.

Don't let the noise of the national media paralyze you. The real opportunities are here, and they are waiting for you. All you need is the right information and a powerful strategy.

# Santa Clarita Real Estate in 2025: Why Now Is the Time to Buy or Sell Your Dream Home

Welcome to the pulse of the Santa Clarita real estate market, where opportunities are ripe for both buyers and sellers in 2025. As Connor MacIvor, your trusted Santa Clarita real estate expert at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com, I’m here to guide you through the latest trends, headlines, and strategies that make this vibrant market a hotspot for homeownership and investment. Whether you’re dreaming of owning a modern single-family home in Valencia, selling a luxury estate in Castaic, or seeking exclusive access to coming-soon listings at SantaClaritaComingSoon.com, this comprehensive analysis will arm you with the knowledge to make informed decisions. Let’s dive into the top real estate headlines shaping Santa Clarita and explore why now is the perfect time to act—plus, discover how a private Zoom consultation with me can craft a personalized plan to achieve your real estate goals.

## The Santa Clarita Real Estate Market: A Snapshot of 2025

Santa Clarita, nestled just 34 miles north of Los Angeles, continues to captivate homebuyers and investors with its blend of suburban serenity, top-tier schools, and proximity to urban amenities. In 2025, the local housing market is buzzing with activity, driven by rising home values, shifting inventory levels, and favorable economic conditions. Let’s break down the key headlines and trends that define the current landscape and how they impact your decision to buy or sell.

### Headline 1: Median Home Values Soar to $925,000 in August 2025

Recent data indicates that the median list price for homes in Santa Clarita reached $925,000 in August 2025, a figure that reflects the area’s enduring appeal. This represents a stabilization from July 2024, but a notable 9% decrease in price per square foot compared to the previous year, now at $367 per square foot. This shift suggests a cooling in per-square-foot pricing, which could signal a strategic opportunity for buyers looking to secure more value for their investment.

For buyers, this trend is a call to action. A 9% drop in price per square foot means you’re getting more home for your money compared to last year. Neighborhoods like Valencia Hills and Scenic Hills are showcasing homes with spacious layouts and modern amenities at competitive prices. For sellers, this stabilization in list prices, combined with a robust median sale price of $790,000 in June 2025, indicates a seller’s market where well-priced homes are moving quickly. My advice? Price strategically and leverage professional marketing to highlight your property’s unique features, ensuring it stands out in a competitive field.

### Headline 2: Inventory Surges to 754 Homes, Up 5.9% Month-Over-Month

Santa Clarita’s housing inventory saw a significant boost in June 2025, with 754 homes available for sale, a 5.9% increase from May 2025. This rise in inventory, particularly for single-family homes and condos, offers buyers a wider selection, from affordable starter homes in Saugus to luxury estates in The Oaks. However, with homes spending an average of 35 days on the market—up from 31 days last year—buyers must act swiftly to secure desirable properties.

This inventory surge is a double-edged sword. For buyers, more choices mean greater flexibility, especially in neighborhoods like Friendly Valley Country Club or Peachland Condominiums, where condos cater to those seeking low-maintenance living. For sellers, increased inventory means heightened competition, making it critical to work with an experienced realtor like me to craft compelling listings. My team at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com uses cutting-edge marketing strategies, including virtual tours and targeted social media campaigns, to ensure your home captures buyer attention before it blends into the growing inventory.

### Headline 3: Mortgage Rates Hit a 10-Month Low, Boosting Buyer Power

A significant development in 2025 is the drop in mortgage rates to a 10-month low, with 30-year fixed rates averaging 6.44%. This decline, coupled with 44.4% of Santa Clarita home sales including seller concessions, creates a buyer-friendly environment. Lower rates mean reduced monthly payments, making it easier for first-time buyers or those upgrading to afford their dream home.

For buyers, this is a golden opportunity. A lower interest rate on a $925,000 home could save you thousands annually, especially when paired with seller concessions like closing cost assistance. My team can help you navigate these financial incentives and connect you with trusted lenders to lock in the best rates. For sellers, offering concessions can make your property more attractive in a market where buyers are weighing multiple options. Schedule a free Zoom consultation with me at SantaClaritaComingSoon.com to explore how to structure your sale for maximum appeal.

### Headline 4: Seller’s Market Persists with 33% of Homes Selling Above Asking Price

Despite increased inventory, Santa Clarita remains a seller’s market in 2025. In June, 33% of homes sold above their listed price, with 60% selling within 30 days. This indicates strong buyer demand, particularly for well-maintained properties in desirable neighborhoods like Holmby Hills or Valencia Northbridge. However, 43% of homes sold below asking, underscoring the importance of pricing accuracy.

Sellers, this is your moment to capitalize on demand. By pricing your home competitively and showcasing its value through professional staging and high-quality photography, you can attract multiple offers. My proven strategies at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com include creating immersive online listings that highlight your home’s best features, from spacious backyards to modern kitchen upgrades. Buyers, don’t be discouraged—working with me gives you access to coming-soon listings, allowing you to get a head start on the competition.

### Headline 5: Commercial Real Estate Thrives, Signaling Economic Strength

Santa Clarita’s commercial real estate sector is also making waves, with significant transactions like the $28.4 million sale of a 214,436-square-foot warehouse in Valencia. This activity reflects the area’s growing economic vitality, driven by its proximity to Los Angeles and a thriving business community. A strong commercial market often correlates with residential stability, as it attracts jobs and infrastructure investment.

For homebuyers, this economic growth enhances Santa Clarita’s appeal as a long-term investment. Neighborhoods like Valencia’s commercial centers are seeing increased demand for nearby homes, as professionals seek convenient commutes. Sellers can leverage this trend by highlighting proximity to commercial hubs in their listings. My team’s local expertise ensures your property is positioned as a prime choice for buyers drawn to Santa Clarita’s economic promise.

## Why Santa Clarita? The Allure of a Premier Housing Market

Santa Clarita’s real estate market is more than just numbers—it’s a lifestyle. Known for its award-winning schools, family-friendly communities, and abundant parks, the city offers a unique blend of suburban charm and urban access. From the master-planned communities of Valencia to the historic charm of Newhall, each neighborhood has its own character, making it a magnet for diverse buyers.

### Neighborhood Spotlight: Valencia

Valencia remains a cornerstone of Santa Clarita’s appeal, with its tree-lined streets, modern amenities, and proximity to shopping centers like the new Sprouts Market complex. Homes here range from $665,000 fixer-uppers to multimillion-dollar estates, catering to a wide range of budgets. The area’s master-planned communities, like Valencia Northbridge, boast community pools, spas, and tennis courts, making them ideal for families and active professionals.

### Neighborhood Spotlight: Saugus and Castaic

Saugus and Castaic offer more affordable options, with median prices closer to $790,000. Saugus is known for its spacious single-family homes, while Castaic’s equestrian properties and large lots appeal to those seeking a rural retreat. Recent developments, like the proposed 375-home project in Saugus, signal continued growth, which could drive future appreciation.

### Neighborhood Spotlight: Luxury in The Oaks and Holmby Hills

For luxury buyers, neighborhoods like The Oaks and Holmby Hills offer expansive lots, custom designs, and high-end finishes. Properties priced over $1.5 million are increasingly common, with some, like a Knochaven Street home listed by former “Dallas” star Linda Gray for $3 million, showcasing the area’s upscale potential. These homes often require longer market times due to a smaller buyer pool, but strategic marketing can yield premium offers.

## Strategies for Buyers: Seizing the Moment in Santa Clarita

The 2025 market presents unique opportunities for buyers, but success requires strategy, speed, and local expertise. Here’s how to navigate the Santa Clarita housing market like a pro:

### 1. Act Quickly with Coming-Soon Listings

With homes selling in as little as 23 days for “hot” properties, timing is critical. My exclusive coming-soon listings at SantaClaritaComingSoon.com give you a head start, letting you view properties before they hit the open market. This insider access can mean the difference between securing your dream home and missing out to a faster bidder.

### 2. Leverage Lower Mortgage Rates

With rates at a 10-month low, now is the time to lock in financing. Work with my network of trusted lenders to secure competitive rates and explore seller concessions to offset closing costs. A free Zoom consultation with me can help you calculate affordability and identify homes that fit your budget, whether it’s a $505,000 condo or a $925,000 single-family home.

### 3. Craft Compelling Offers

In a market where 33% of homes sell above asking, your offer needs to stand out. Personalize your bid with a letter to the seller, minimize contingencies, and be prepared to act fast. My team’s negotiation expertise ensures your offer is competitive without overextending your finances.

### 4. Explore Diverse Neighborhoods

Santa Clarita’s diverse neighborhoods offer something for everyone. Be open to areas like Saugus for affordability or Valencia for amenities. Attending open houses, like those listed at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com, provides firsthand insight into local trends and helps you discover hidden gems.

### 5. Partner with a Local Expert

A realtor with deep Santa Clarita knowledge is your greatest asset. My decades of experience as a former LAPD officer turned realtor (CALDRE 01238257) give me a unique perspective on the market. I’ll guide you through every step, from property selection to closing, ensuring a seamless experience.

## Strategies for Sellers: Maximizing Your Home’s Value

Sellers in Santa Clarita are in a strong position, but success hinges on strategic pricing and marketing. Here’s how to make your home the top choice for buyers:

### 1. Price Competitively

With 43% of homes selling below asking, overpricing can lead to longer market times. My team conducts detailed market analyses to set a price that attracts buyers while maximizing your return. For example, a well-priced Valencia home can generate multiple offers within days.

### 2. Invest in Professional Marketing

High-quality photography, virtual tours, and targeted social media campaigns are non-negotiable in 2025. My team at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com creates immersive listings that showcase your home’s best features, from updated kitchens to expansive backyards. We also leverage platforms like LinkedIn and Instagram to reach a broad audience.

### 3. Offer Strategic Concessions

With 44.4% of sales including seller concessions, consider offering closing cost assistance or minor repairs to sweeten the deal. These incentives can attract more buyers without significantly impacting your bottom line.

### 4. Highlight Neighborhood Appeal

Buyers are drawn to Santa Clarita’s lifestyle. Emphasize proximity to top schools, parks, or commercial hubs in your listing. For example, a home near the William S. Hart School District or the new Sprouts Market complex can command premium interest.

### 5. Work with a Proven Realtor

My track record of closing 53 homes in just seven days demonstrates my ability to deliver results. A free Zoom consultation at SantaClaritaComingSoon.com allows us to craft a tailored selling strategy, from staging to negotiation, ensuring your home sells quickly and profitably.

## The Bigger Picture: National Trends and Their Local Impact

Santa Clarita’s market doesn’t exist in a vacuum—it’s influenced by broader real estate trends. Here’s how national headlines are shaping the local landscape:

### National Headline: Existing Home Sales Up 2% in July 2025

Nationally, existing home sales rose 2% in July, driven by lower mortgage rates and increased inventory. This trend mirrors Santa Clarita’s market, where a 5.9% inventory increase and lower rates are boosting buyer activity. For local buyers, this means more options but also more competition, making early access to listings critical.

### National Headline: Commission Rates Tick Higher Post-MLS Changes

Despite industry changes to buyer agreements, commission rates have slightly increased. In Santa Clarita, this underscores the value of working with an experienced realtor who can justify their commission through results. My team’s comprehensive services, from market analysis to closing support, ensure you get maximum value.

### National Headline: Climate Risks Reshaping Luxury Markets

Climate concerns, like the projected 171% increase in days over 99°F in Santa Clarita over the next 30 years, are influencing buyer decisions. High-net-worth buyers are prioritizing properties with sustainable features, such as energy-efficient designs. Sellers can appeal to this demographic by highlighting eco-friendly upgrades, like solar panels or drought-resistant landscaping.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
