# Is your agent talking too much and not listening to you - First Responder Agent

Connor "with Honor" MacIvor - October 16, 2024** [0 Comments](/#comments) | [Add Comment](/#add-comment)
The Santa Clarita real estate market can be a dynamic and ever-changing landscape. Whether you're buying or selling a home, having a trusted, experienced professional at your side can make all the difference. As a **First Responder Realtor**, I, **Connor with Honor**, bring a unique blend of integrity, attention to detail, and commitment—shaped by my years serving with the LAPD—to ensure your real estate journey is smooth, honest, and successful.

**Understanding the Market**

*“Today is October 16th, 2024, and we’re at day 290,”* I begin each daily update. Keeping track of **Santa Clarita Valley's real estate inventory** helps me ensure that I give my clients the most up-to-date insights. With new listings entering the market, price changes, and properties going back on the market due to financing issues or other factors, the local real estate scene can shift quickly. This is why I make it a priority to analyze trends, highlight price corrections, and stay ahead of the curve so you know whether now is a good time to buy or sell.

When buying, ask your agent the tough questions: "Does this feel like the right time to buy?" Ensure they're offering sound advice and not overpromising, because what you don’t want is someone who tells you only what you want to hear. I recommend clients follow up with an email to clarify any details discussed during meetings with their agent or lender. Miscommunications happen, and ensuring everything is clear and in writing is a simple but essential step to protect your interests.

**Choosing the Right Representation**

One piece of advice I can’t stress enough is the importance of choosing the right real estate agent. When you sit down with an agent, ask yourself:

	- Are they **listening** more than they’re talking?

	- Are they **addressing your specific needs** or giving generic advice?

	- Do they have the guts to tell you if something is **unrealistic** or outside of what’s possible in the market?

In the same way that we built trust and accountability in law enforcement, my real estate practice is built on open communication and transparency. **Connor with Honor** isn’t just a name—it’s a commitment to always acting with honesty and integrity.

**Understanding the Process**

Navigating the process can sometimes feel overwhelming, especially when it comes to **contracts**. Many buyers don’t realize that signing a contract to look at homes is part of the standard process. If you’re working with an agent who doesn’t require this, you should ask questions because it may be against the rules. Contracts protect both parties—just as important for buyers as for sellers—and are a key part of the process to ensure everything is transparent.

If you find yourself needing to inject extra money into a transaction (above the appraised value), make sure the loan program you are using allows for this. Not all financing options give buyers the flexibility to cover additional costs beyond what the lender is willing to loan. This small detail could make or break a deal, and it’s critical to address it upfront to avoid last-minute complications.

**Navigating Price Changes**

In this market, **sellers sometimes overprice** their homes based on outdated expectations, reflecting price trends from the mid-2000s. As a buyer, it's essential to understand that pricing too high can hurt you in the long run, and I always make sure to educate my clients on how to avoid that trap.

For sellers, if you price your home reasonably and market it well, buyers will be willing to pay the asking price. However, it's vital to understand that many loan programs will only lend based on the appraised value of the home. So, if a buyer agrees to a higher price, they need to be prepared to bring in additional funds if the appraisal doesn’t match. As your agent, I ensure these conversations are part of the negotiation so that everyone understands what’s required from the start.

**Handling Setbacks and Backup Offers**

As part of my daily updates, I often discuss **properties that fall out of escrow** and re-enter the market. It happens more often than you might think—buyers may run into financing issues or face personal setbacks that prevent them from completing the purchase. If a home you’re interested in falls through, be ready to **step in with a backup offer**. It’s not uncommon for backup offers to win out, so don’t hesitate to keep your options open.

On the seller’s side, it can be frustrating when a deal falls through, but rest assured that it’s often due to circumstances beyond anyone’s control. Stay patient, trust the process, and ensure that you and your agent are aligned on how to move forward when the next offer comes in.

**Tips for Buyers: Avoid Financing Pitfalls**

Here’s one more tip for buyers: **Don’t make big financial moves during escrow**. Financing a car or making large purchases can alter your creditworthiness, which could jeopardize your mortgage approval. Even paying off debts during this period could negatively impact your approval status, so always consult with your lender before making any major financial decisions while you're in the home-buying process.

**Final Thoughts**

As your First Responder Realtor, I don’t just sell homes—I offer guidance that’s rooted in years of experience, dedication, and a commitment to protecting your interests. From helping you navigate the market, understanding contracts, and keeping an eye on financing, I’m here to save the world—one honest real estate transaction at a time.

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
