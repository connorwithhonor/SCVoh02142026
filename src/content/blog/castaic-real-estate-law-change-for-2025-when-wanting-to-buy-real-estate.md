## AB2992: How This New Law Changes California Real Estate

Effective January 2025,&nbsp;**Assembly Bill 2992 (AB2992)**&nbsp;introduces mandatory changes to real estate transactions, reshaping the buyer-agent relationship. Here’s what you need to know:

### **Key Provisions of AB2992**

	- 
	**Mandatory Buyer-Broker Agreements**:

	
		Buyers must sign a formal agreement with their agent before viewing properties.

		- These agreements outline the agent’s role, responsibilities, and compensation.

	

	
	- 
	**Customization of Agreements**:

	
		Agreements can be tailored to specific types of properties, time frames, or even individual transactions. For example, a buyer may engage an agent exclusively for three-bedroom homes or properties near golf courses.

	

	
	- 
	**Transparency in Agent Compensation**:

	
		Sellers are no longer required to cover buyer-agent fees. Buyers may need to negotiate or pay these fees directly, increasing the importance of understanding the agent’s value.

	

	
	- 
	**Disclosure Requirements**:

	
		Agents must clearly define their obligations and the buyer’s rights within the agreement, ensuring full transparency.

	

	

### **Buyer Considerations**

	- **Evaluate Agent Value**: Assess the agent’s expertise, market knowledge, and commitment before signing an agreement.

	- **Negotiate Compensation**: Discuss agent fees upfront and ensure they align with the value provided.

### **Seller Considerations**

	- **Adapt Pricing Strategies**: With buyers potentially covering agent fees, sellers must price competitively to attract offers.
