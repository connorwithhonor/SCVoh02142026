The path to transforming your health is a lot like navigating the real estate journey—both require dedication, strategy, and sometimes even a leap of faith. As someone who once weighed 365 pounds, with a 65” waist, I know the challenges of transformation. I didn’t just lose weight; I redefined my approach to life, health, and, ultimately, how I serve as a realtor. My success in the Santa Clarita real estate market is rooted in the same principles that helped me shed over 135 pounds and turn my life around.

If you’re looking for the right guide in your real estate journey, know that you’re working with someone who understands what it means to overcome obstacles, set clear goals, and succeed, even when the odds seem stacked against you.

#### **From Fat to Fit: A Journey of Transformation**

There was a time when I struggled with weight. Carrying extra pounds felt like having an anchor attached to every step I took. Even basic tasks became monumental challenges, and I knew I had to make a change. That journey began with fasting and continued through a combination of smart nutrition, fitness, and testosterone therapy, which helped normalize my energy levels and overall health.

Today, I’m proud to say I’ve dropped over 135 pounds, and I use that experience to guide me not just in my personal life but in my career. Real estate may not seem connected to health and fitness at first glance, but the discipline, commitment, and resilience needed to achieve goals in both fields have more in common than you might think.

#### **Standing vs. Sitting: How Small Changes Make a Big Difference**

One of the first adjustments I made was incorporating more movement into my daily routine. Like many of us, I was sitting all day, working at a desk, and I realized the impact it had on my health. I invested in a standing desk to keep myself more active throughout the day.

This isn’t just advice for health enthusiasts—this is crucial for anyone who spends long hours at a desk. Real estate work can be incredibly sedentary; there’s plenty of paperwork, research, and client management that happens behind a screen. But even when I’m not showing homes or meeting clients, I stay active. Standing while working gives me energy and focus, and I share this lifestyle with anyone who will listen, including clients who are looking to make positive changes in their own lives.

#### **Building a Foundation with Fasting and Smart Nutrition**

My transformation involved more than just standing; it was rooted in two core practices: fasting and balanced nutrition. I embraced fasting after reading *The Obesity Code* by Dr. Jason Fung. His approach to intermittent fasting made perfect sense, and I began implementing it into my life. It wasn’t just about weight loss—it was about giving my body the time it needed to reset and focus on fat stores.

In a similar way, buying or selling a home can benefit from a “reset.” Just as fasting allowed my body to burn fat stores, taking time to research and prepare allows real estate clients to make better decisions and avoid costly mistakes. My personal journey with fasting has shown me the power of patience, preparation, and strategy—qualities that I bring to every transaction.

#### **Testosterone Therapy and a Commitment to Wellness**

During my weight loss journey, I also discovered the importance of hormone health. Years of stress, overwork, and unhealthy habits had lowered my testosterone levels, impacting my energy, mood, and physical health. After consulting with a doctor, I started testosterone therapy, which helped balance my hormones and restored my vitality.

In real estate, I’ve noticed that clients often come to me feeling drained or frustrated by the process. Whether buying or selling, it’s a significant commitment that can take an emotional toll. My journey taught me that taking care of oneself is essential, and I bring that insight to my clients by encouraging a healthy mindset throughout their real estate journey. I’m here to make sure you have the support and confidence to achieve your goals.

#### **How My Health Transformation Impacts My Real Estate Work**

	- 
	**Energy and Focus for Every Client**

	Losing weight and maintaining a healthy lifestyle have boosted my energy and mental clarity, which I channel into my work. When you’re working with me, you’re not getting someone who’s half-committed or burnt out. You’re working with someone who brings the same level of focus to every interaction that I used to transform my own life.

	

	- 
	**Active Lifestyle in a Fast-Paced Market**

	In Santa Clarita, the real estate market is competitive. Staying active and alert isn’t optional—it’s essential. My health journey taught me resilience and adaptability, which are crucial when navigating the fluctuating demands of the real estate market.

	

	- 
	**Accountability and Goal-Setting**

	Weight loss requires accountability. I had to hold myself to a high standard and commit to consistent, disciplined choices. This mirrors how I work with clients: setting clear goals, being transparent, and holding myself accountable to ensure you get the best experience possible.

	

#### **Tips for Staying Active When Working from Home**

As someone who spends time both in the office and out in the field, here are a few practical tips for staying active during a desk-heavy workday:

	- **Set Up a Standing Desk**: If you haven’t already, consider investing in a standing desk. It allows you to shift from sitting to standing, keeping your circulation going and boosting your energy.

	- **Use Small Weights or Water Bottles**: Keep a couple of water bottles at your desk for quick arm workouts. Do some bicep curls, shoulder presses, or tricep exercises in between tasks.

	- **Take Quick Walks**: Schedule short walking breaks. A five-minute walk around the office or your workspace can refresh your mind and reduce stress.

	- **Stretch Regularly**: Keep your muscles flexible and avoid stiffness by stretching throughout the day.

#### **How My Journey Resonates with the Santa Clarita Community**

My journey from “fat to fit” isn’t just a personal victory—it’s a story I share with the Santa Clarita community. Santa Clarita is a place where people value quality of life, community, and personal growth. Many of my clients are working professionals, first responders, and families looking for a safe, vibrant environment to call home.

I’ve built a business around supporting this vision. My “Fat to Fit First Responder” business is my way of encouraging others who might be facing similar health challenges. Just as I’m committed to finding the right home for every client, I’m dedicated to helping others find the right path to health, fitness, and overall well-being.

#### **Final Thoughts: Real Estate as a Lifestyle, Not Just a Job**

For me, real estate isn’t just a career; it’s an extension of my commitment to service. Whether I’m helping clients find their dream home or guiding them through the complexities of selling, I bring the same discipline, energy, and resilience that helped me transform my own life. If you’re looking to make a change—whether it’s buying a new home or starting a journey to better health—I’m here as your partner in the process.
