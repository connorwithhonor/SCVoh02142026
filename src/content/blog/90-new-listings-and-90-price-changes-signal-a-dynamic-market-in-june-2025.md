## Strategies for Buyers in Santa Clarita’s June 2025 Market

With 90 new listings and 90 price changes, buyers have opportunities but face competition. Here’s how to succeed:

### Get Pre-Approved Early

Before touring homes, secure a mortgage pre-approval to strengthen your offer. With median home prices around $820,000, knowing your budget is crucial. Contact a trusted lender through SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com’s Mortgage Rates page to explore your options.

### Act Quickly on New Listings

With homes going pending in as few as 22 days, speed is essential. Use SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com’s Quick Search to get real-time updates on new listings.

### Leverage Price Changes

The 90 price changes offer opportunities to find value. Focus on homes with recent reductions, as sellers may be motivated to close quickly.

### Consider Buyer Agreements

In California, buyers are now required to sign a buyer-broker agreement before viewing homes. This protects both you and your agent, ensuring clear expectations.

## Strategies for Sellers in Santa Clarita’s June 2025 Market

With 73 closings and 90 price changes, sellers need to stand out in a competitive market. Here’s how to maximize your sale:

### Price Competitively

The 90 price changes highlight the importance of pricing your home correctly from the start. Overpricing can lead to longer days on market, while strategic pricing attracts multiple offers.

### Stage and Market Professionally

In a market with 559 active listings, presentation is key. Professional staging and high-quality photos can shorten your home’s time on the market.

### Offer Seller Concessions

With buyers facing high borrowing costs, offering concessions—like covering closing costs or repairs—can make your home more attractive.

### Understand the Net Sheet

Before accepting offers, review a net sheet to understand your proceeds after commissions and fees. This ensures no surprises at closing.

The Santa Clarita Valley’s diverse cities offer something for every buyer. Here’s a quick look at key neighborhoods based on recent market trends:

Valencia is a top choice for families and professionals, with its planned communities, parks, and proximity to major employers. Median home prices here are around $860,000, with homes selling in about 32 days.

### Saugus: Family-Friendly and Affordable

Saugus offers a mix of single-family homes and condos, with median prices slightly below the valley average. It’s ideal for first-time buyers.

### Newhall: Historic Charm Meets Modern Growth

Newhall’s revitalized downtown is drawing buyers seeking a blend of history and modern amenities. Home prices are appreciating steadily, with a year-over-year increase of 2.4%.

### Canyon Country: Space and Value

Canyon Country offers larger lots and more affordable homes, appealing to buyers seeking space.
