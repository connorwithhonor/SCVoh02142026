Welcome to my new and improved real estate website. I invite you to look around and see what is available. As your Santa Clarita, California real estate expert I can provide you will all of the information to accomplish your real estate goals.

**Save your search!**

Saving your search is an important step if&nbsp;if you would like to be able to quickly refer back to your search at a future date. &nbsp;More importantly I will be able to quickly notify you directly of any new listings that come available on the market that match your search criteria. &nbsp;The beautiful thing is that you can make as many of these saved searches as you would like.

First, you must be registered on our website. This is easy. It only requires your first and last name, an email address and a password. [Register Here](/Web/AR1197716/WebUser/register/). To save any search, simply perform a search using the Quick Search or Advanced Search, click on the “search” button, and then click “save search”, which is located in the top right hand corner just above the search results. This will prompt you to title your saved search and provide you with the option of being notified by email. &nbsp;Check the box to be notified by email of new listings that match your search.

To look at or edit your saved searches, you must be logged in. On the homepage, top right hand corner is where you can view your saved searches. Click this link and you will then see all the searches you saved, you can delete them, edit the email notifications and more.

If you would like any assistance, please do not hesitate to Contact Me or call me directly at (661) 400-1720

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
