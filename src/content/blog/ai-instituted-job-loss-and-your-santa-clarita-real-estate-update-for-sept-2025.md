# The Shocking Collision of Real Estate and AI: How to Thrive in a Market (and World) on the Brink

  
Welcome to the wild ride that is 2025, where the real estate market in Santa Clarita Valley is heating up, and artificial intelligence is flexing its muscles, threatening jobs and changing how we live. I’m Connor MacIvor—ex-LAPD motor cop, Realtor (CALDRE 01238257), AI adopter, and a guy who dropped 135 pounds by mastering fasting. Buckle up as we dive into how the Fed’s moves could ignite the housing market, why sellers are stuck in “golden handcuffs,” and how AI’s exponential growth is about to rewrite the rules of work. This isn’t just a market update—it’s a wake-up call for anyone looking to buy, sell, or survive the AI revolution.

## Santa Clarita Real Estate: A Market on the Edge

### The Numbers Don’t Lie: 747 Listings and Counting

As of September 15, 2025, Santa Clarita Valley boasts 747 active listings—single-family homes, condos, and townhomes. That’s a solid inventory, but we’re still in a seller’s market. Properties priced right? They’re gone in 30-45 days, sometimes faster in hotter pockets. Buyers, you’ve got more choices than last year, but don’t expect a fire sale. Sellers still hold the upper hand, especially if their home is move-in ready.

### The Fed’s Big Meeting: Will Rates Finally Budge?

The Federal Reserve is meeting September 16-17, 2025, and the rumor mill is churning: they might cut the Fed funds rate. Now, before you pop the champagne, let’s get real. The Fed funds rate isn’t the mortgage rate—it’s what banks use to lend each other money. Mortgage rates? They’re tied more to the 10-year Treasury note, which fluctuates daily. Still, a Fed cut could nudge mortgage rates down, and even a small drop could unleash a wave of buyers.

### Sellers: Stand Out or Get Left Behind

If you’re selling in Santa Clarita, competition is real. Neighborhoods with multiple listings mean buyers are comparing your home to the shiny, upgraded one next door. Got aluminum wiring, galvanized pipes, or a 40-year-old kitchen? You’re not winning any bidding wars unless you’ve got a killer view or a massive lot.

### Buyers: Prep Now, Win Later

If you’ve been sitting on the sidelines because rates were too high, the Fed’s move could be your green light. But don’t wait for the headlines—get ahead of the pack.

## AI’s Meteoric Rise: Job Killer or Opportunity Creator?

### The AI Revolution Is Here—And It’s Moving Fast

Artificial intelligence isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a game-changer. Since August 2025, AI systems have started self-improving, training on synthetic data and rewriting their own code. We’re not talking decades away; this is happening now. Experts say AI’s IQ is already around 140-150, closing in on Einstein-level (160). By 2035, we could hit Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—where machines outsmart every human in every field. Buckle up for Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) after that, where we’re staring into the singularity: a future we can’t predict.

### AI in Real Estate: Friend or Foe?

For realtors, AI’s a double-edged sword. It can write property descriptions, analyze market trends, and handle client inquiries 24/7. But it’s not perfect—yet. AI might call a main bedroom a “master” (a no-no in today’s market) or assume every room has a ceiling fan. That’s why you need a human to vet its output.

### Job Loss: The Brutal Truth

AI’s already replacing jobs—15 call center workers at $35,000 a year? Gone, swapped for an AI that books appointments without coffee breaks or attitude. Businesses love the bottom line, and AI’s dirt cheap compared to humans.

### The Singularity Looms

We’re hurtling toward a point where AI’s smarter than us in ways we can’t grasp. It’s like trying to understand a black hole—we’re guessing, not knowing. The systems are already “agenic,” improving themselves without human input. That’s both thrilling and terrifying.

## Life Lessons: From Fasting to Forgiveness

Dropping 135 pounds at 52 wasn’t just about fasting—it was about forgiving myself when I slipped up. Ate a donut? Don’t spiral into a three-month taco binge. Stop, reset, move on. That’s the key to weight loss and life.

## Why Work With Me?

I’m Connor MacIvor—ex-LAPD, Realtor, AI trailblazer, and fasting advocate. I’ve walked the walk, from busting crime to building wealth and transforming my body. Whether you’re buying, selling, or navigating AI’s impact, I’ve got your back with real insights, no fluff.
