# The Ultimate Guide to Final Walkthroughs in Santa Clarita Real Estate: What Buyers and Sellers Need to Know

**TL;DR**: The final walkthrough is a critical step in Santa Clarita real estate, ensuring the property is delivered as promised before escrow closes.

This 5000+ word guide covers everything from handling uncompleted repairs to navigating tenant holdovers in foreclosures. Watch my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)) for a quick overview. As Connor MacIvor (CALDRE 01238257), a former LAPD motor cop turned realtor, I bring a no-nonsense approach to guide you through this process.

## Introduction: Why the Final Walkthrough Is a Game-Changer in Santa Clarita Real Estate

Imagine you’re just days away from closing on your dream home in Santa Clarita—or you’re a seller ready to pass the keys to a new owner. Everything’s lined up perfectly: the offer’s accepted, the inspections are done, and escrow’s almost closed. Then, at the final walkthrough, you discover a promised repair wasn’t completed, or worse, a tenant refuses to leave. Suddenly, your smooth deal is teetering on the edge of chaos. That’s where the final walkthrough comes in—it’s your last chance to ensure everything’s as it should be before the deal is sealed.

As a former LAPD motor cop turned realtor (CALDRE 01238257), I’ve swapped high-speed chases for high-stakes real estate deals. My years of handling intense situations on the streets have sharpened my ability to spot issues and solve problems fast. In my recent YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)), I break down why the final walkthrough is your ultimate defense against costly surprises. This 5000+ word guide dives deeper, offering practical tips, real-world scenarios, and expert advice to navigate the final walkthrough in Santa Clarita’s competitive market.

Whether you’re buying a condo in Canyon Country ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/condos-for-sale-in-canyon-country-ca](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/condos-for-sale-in-canyon-country-ca)) or selling a luxury home in Stevenson Ranch ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-stevenson-ranch-ca](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-stevenson-ranch-ca)), I’ve got your back. Let’s dive into the final walkthrough process and how to ace it like a pro.

## What Is a Final Walkthrough?

The final walkthrough is the buyer’s last opportunity to inspect a property before escrow closes, typically scheduled 24–48 hours before the closing date. It’s not a full home inspection—that happens earlier in the process—but a focused check to confirm the property is in the agreed-upon condition, all repairs are complete, and no new issues have surfaced. For sellers, it’s about proving you’ve met your contractual obligations, from leaving the home clean to ensuring utilities are on.

In my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)), I explain how the walkthrough catches issues like uncompleted repairs or unexpected tenants, particularly in foreclosure scenarios. In Santa Clarita, where inventory hit a record-breaking 505 active listings in July 2025 ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/505-the-highest-number-of-santa-clarita-real-estate-listings-in-over-two-years](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/505-the-highest-number-of-santa-clarita-real-estate-listings-in-over-two-years)), a smooth walkthrough can keep your deal on track in this fast-paced market.

### Why It’s Critical

	- **Buyers**: Ensures the home hasn’t been damaged since your offer, repairs are done, and utilities are functional.

	- **Sellers**: Confirms you’ve fulfilled your duties, avoiding disputes or delays.

	- **Both Parties**: Provides peace of mind and ensures a fair, transparent closing.

As a first responder turned realtor, I approach walkthroughs with the same precision I used in law enforcement—checking every detail to protect your interests.

## The Santa Clarita Real Estate Market: Setting the Stage

Santa Clarita’s real estate market is a wild ride, with high inventory levels creating opportunities for buyers and challenges for sellers. As of July 2025, we’re seeing over 505 active listings—the highest in over two years ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/505-the-highest-number-of-santa-clarita-real-estate-listings-in-over-two-years](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/505-the-highest-number-of-santa-clarita-real-estate-listings-in-over-two-years)). This surge means buyers have more choices, from affordable condos in Valencia ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/condos-for-sale-in-valencia-ca](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/condos-for-sale-in-valencia-ca)) to gated homes in Saugus ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/gated-homes-for-sale-in-saugus-ca](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/gated-homes-for-sale-in-saugus-ca)). For sellers, it’s a competitive landscape where a flawless final walkthrough can set you apart.

My YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)) gives a quick snapshot of what to expect during a walkthrough, but this guide dives into the details, covering everything from repairs to tenant issues. Whether you’re a first-time buyer or a seasoned seller, understanding the walkthrough process is key to closing with confidence.

## What to Expect During a Final Walkthrough in Santa Clarita

The final walkthrough typically lasts 30–60 minutes, depending on the property’s size and complexity. Here’s a breakdown of what buyers and sellers should anticipate:

### For Buyers

	- **Verify Repairs**: Confirm all agreed-upon repairs, like fixing dry rot or replacing a broken window, are complete. These should be documented in writing during escrow.

	- **Check Property Condition**: Look for new damage, such as water stains, vandalism, or wear and tear, that wasn’t present during the home inspection.

	- **Test Utilities**: Ensure water, electricity, gas, and HVAC systems are operational. Sellers must keep utilities on until closing.

	- **Confirm Fixtures and Appliances**: Verify that items included in the sale (e.g., refrigerator, light fixtures) are present and functional.

	- **Assess Cleanliness**: The home should be broom-clean, free of debris and personal items.

	- **Check for Tenants**: In rare cases, like foreclosures, tenants may refuse to leave, as I noted in my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)).

### For Sellers

	- **Complete Repairs**: Finish all agreed-upon repairs and provide documentation, such as receipts or invoices.

	- **Clean the Property**: Hire a professional cleaning service to ensure the home is spotless.

	- **Keep Utilities On**: Maintain active utilities until closing to allow buyers to test systems.

	- **Remove Personal Items**: Clear out all belongings, including those in garages, attics, or sheds.

	- **Address Tenant Issues**: If selling a tenant-occupied property, ensure tenants have vacated before the walkthrough.

### Common Issues During Walkthroughs

	- **Uncompleted Repairs**: A promised repair, like a leaky faucet, isn’t fixed.

	- **Tenant Holdovers**: Tenants refuse to leave, especially in foreclosures ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/foreclosure-search](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/foreclosure-search)).

	- **Missing Fixtures**: Sellers remove items that were supposed to stay.

	- **Utilities Off**: Buyers can’t test systems if utilities are disconnected.

	- **New Damage**: Damage from movers, storms, or neglect can spark disputes.

To avoid these pitfalls, work with a realtor who knows Santa Clarita’s market inside out. I’ve handled countless walkthroughs and can spot issues before they derail your deal. Contact me at 661-888-4983 or book a free consultation at [https://www.zoomescv.com/](https://www.zoomescv.com/).

## The Power of Written Agreements in Final Walkthroughs

As I mentioned in my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)), “either already been a disc about why it isn’t and that that particular issue as via some kind of writt the escrow process, usuall for repairs.” Written agreements are the backbone of a smooth walkthrough, ensuring clarity and accountability for both parties.

### Why Written Agreements Are Essential

	- **Clarity**: They spell out exactly what repairs or concessions the seller is responsible for, avoiding misunderstandings.

	- **Legal Protection**: If a seller fails to complete repairs, a written agreement gives buyers leverage to request remedies.

	- **Transparency**: Both parties know what’s expected, reducing disputes during the walkthrough.

For example, if a home inspection revealed dry rot in a window frame, the buyer and seller might agree in writing that the seller will repair it before closing. During the walkthrough, the buyer can verify the repair was completed to their satisfaction. Without a written agreement, disputes can escalate, delaying closing or leading to legal issues.

### Tips for Buyers

	- **Review the Contract**: Before the walkthrough, go over the purchase agreement and any repair addendums. Know exactly what the seller promised to fix.

	- **Bring Documentation**: Have copies of the home inspection report and repair agreements for reference during the walkthrough.

	- **Hire a Professional**: For major repairs (e.g., plumbing or electrical), consider bringing a contractor or inspector to verify the work.

### Tips for Sellers

	- **Document Everything**: Keep receipts, invoices, and photos of completed repairs to show the buyer.

	- **Communicate Early**: If a repair can’t be completed before closing, notify the buyer’s agent in writing and propose a solution, like a credit or escrow holdback.

	- **Work with Your Realtor**: I can coordinate with contractors to ensure repairs meet buyer expectations, saving you time and stress.

For more on the importance of written agreements, check out my blog post at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-buyers-need-written-agreements-by-the-first-responder-realtor](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-buyers-need-written-agreements-by-the-first-responder-realtor).

## Navigating Tenant Holdovers and Foreclosure Challenges

During the foreclosure wave, final walkthroughs could be a logistical nightmare. As I noted in my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)), “back in the day was kind o in the last foreclosure we would go through prope closing and those people tenants, they didn’t want weren’t going anywhere.” While tenant holdovers are less common today, they still occur, especially with investment properties or foreclosures listed on [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/foreclosure-search](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/foreclosure-search).

### Handling Tenant Holdovers

	- **Notify the Seller or Bank**: In foreclosures, the bank or seller is responsible for evicting tenants before closing.

	- **Delay Closing**: If tenants are still present, buyers may request a delay until the issue is resolved.

	- **Legal Action**: In rare cases, legal action may be needed to remove tenants. A realtor experienced in foreclosures can coordinate with the necessary parties.

### Tips for Buyers

	- **Ask About Occupancy**: Before making an offer, confirm whether the property is tenant-occupied and what the eviction process entails.

	- **Work with a Foreclosure Expert**: I’ve handled numerous foreclosure transactions and know how to navigate these complexities. Learn more at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/thinking-about-buying-a-foreclosure](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/thinking-about-buying-a-foreclosure).

### Tips for Sellers

	- **Plan Ahead**: If selling a tenant-occupied property, start the eviction process early to avoid delays.

	- **Be Transparent**: Disclose any tenant issues to the buyer upfront to prevent walkthrough surprises.

## Preparing for a Successful Final Walkthrough

Preparation is the key to a seamless final walkthrough. Here’s how buyers and sellers can get ready:

### For Buyers

	- **Create a Checklist**: List all items to check, including repairs, appliances, and utilities. Use the home inspection report as a guide.

	- **Bring Tools**: A flashlight, outlet tester, and measuring tape help inspect hard-to-see areas or confirm room dimensions.

	- **Test Everything**: Turn on faucets, flush toilets, run the dishwasher, and test the HVAC system to ensure functionality.

	- **Take Photos**: Document the property’s condition in case disputes arise later.

	- **Work with Your Realtor**: A knowledgeable realtor like me can guide you through the process and spot issues you might miss. Contact me at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/contact](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/contact) or 661-888-4983.

### For Sellers

	- **Complete Repairs Early**: Don’t wait until the last minute. Hire licensed contractors and keep records of all work.

	- **Clean Thoroughly**: Hire a professional cleaning service to ensure the home is spotless.

	- **Keep Utilities On**: Arrange for utilities to stay active until the closing date.

	- **Remove Personal Items**: Double-check attics, garages, and sheds to ensure all belongings are removed.

	- **Provide Documentation**: Share repair receipts and warranties with the buyer’s agent to confirm compliance.

## Real-World Final Walkthrough Scenarios in Santa Clarita

Let’s explore some common scenarios you might encounter during a final walkthrough in Santa Clarita, along with solutions:

### Scenario 1: Uncompleted Repairs

**Issue**: The seller agreed to fix a broken garage door, but it’s still malfunctioning during the walkthrough.

**Solution**: Document the issue with photos and notify your realtor immediately. You can request a credit, delay closing until the repair is complete, or renegotiate terms. A written repair agreement is crucial here.

### Scenario 2: Missing Fixtures

**Issue**: The seller removed a chandelier that was supposed to stay with the home.

**Solution**: Refer to the purchase agreement to confirm what was included in the sale. Your realtor can negotiate a replacement or credit. Learn more about purchase agreements at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/the-2024-residential-purchase-agreement-for-a-home-buyer-buying-real-estate](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/the-2024-residential-purchase-agreement-for-a-home-buyer-buying-real-estate).

### Scenario 3: Utilities Turned Off

**Issue**: The electricity is off, so you can’t test the appliances or HVAC system.

**Solution**: Contact the seller’s agent to have utilities turned back on. If this isn’t possible before closing, request a delay or a contingency to verify systems post-closing.

### Scenario 4: Tenant Holdover

**Issue**: A tenant is still living in the property and refuses to leave, as seen in foreclosure scenarios.

**Solution**: Coordinate with the seller or bank to initiate eviction proceedings. Delay closing until the property is vacant. My YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)) highlights this issue.

### Scenario 5: New Damage

**Issue**: You notice water damage from a recent storm that wasn’t present during the home inspection.

**Solution**: Document the damage and notify your realtor. You may need to file an insurance claim or renegotiate with the seller to cover repair costs.

These scenarios underscore the importance of working with a realtor who can handle unexpected challenges. My experience as a first responder turned realtor ensures quick, effective solutions.

## Pricing Strategies and Their Impact on the Final Walkthrough

In my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)), I touch on pricing misconceptions: “a little bit about quite pricing strategy because the misconception. Well, market, there’s going to going to be an issue.” Pricing your home correctly is crucial, as it influences buyer expectations and the scrutiny they bring to the final walkthrough.

### Why Pricing Matters

	- **Savvy Buyers**: Today’s buyers use tools like [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/advanced-search](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/advanced-search) to compare properties. Overpricing can lead to longer days on market and pickier walkthroughs.

	- **Avoid Price Reductions**: Frequent price changes ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/price-changes-galore-in-the-santa-clarita-real-estate-world-mid-july-2024](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/price-changes-galore-in-the-santa-clarita-real-estate-world-mid-july-2024)) can signal desperation, making buyers more critical during the walkthrough.

	- **Justification Letters**: If your home is priced above or below market value, a justification letter can explain why, reducing disputes during the walkthrough.

### Tips for Sellers

	- **Price Competitively**: Work with your realtor to set a price based on recent comps ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/free-market-analysis](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/free-market-analysis)).

	- **Highlight Unique Features**: If your price reflects a pool or new construction, emphasize these early to set buyer expectations.

	- **Prepare for Scrutiny**: A well-priced home is less likely to face nitpicking during the walkthrough.

## Leveraging AI to Enhance the Final Walkthrough Process

As an AI influencer and adopter ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/artificial-intelligence-in-real-estate](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/artificial-intelligence-in-real-estate)), I see how technology can streamline real estate processes, including final walkthroughs. Here’s how AI can help:

	- **Virtual Walkthroughs**: AI-powered 3D tours let buyers preview properties remotely before the final walkthrough, reducing surprises.

	- **Predictive Analytics**: AI analyzes market data to flag potential issues, like repair costs or pricing disputes.

	- **Document Management**: AI organizes repair agreements and escrow documents, ensuring nothing is missed.

## Common Misconceptions About Final Walkthroughs

There are several myths about final walkthroughs that can trip up buyers and sellers. Let’s debunk a few:

### Myth 1: The Walkthrough Is Just a Formality

**Reality**: The walkthrough is your last chance to catch issues before closing. Skipping it or rushing through can lead to costly oversights, like missing a broken HVAC system or uncompleted repairs.

### Myth 2: All Repairs Are Optional

**Reality**: If repairs are agreed upon in writing during escrow, they’re binding. As I noted in my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)), any issues not addressed should have been discussed and documented beforehand.

### Myth 3: Buyers Can Demand New Repairs

**Reality**: The walkthrough isn’t for identifying new issues—it’s for verifying agreed-upon conditions. New issues may require negotiation or insurance claims.

### Myth 4: Sellers Can Leave Personal Items

**Reality**: Unless specified in the contract, the home should be empty and clean. Leaving items behind can lead to disputes.

## How to Handle Disputes During the Final Walkthrough

Disputes during the final walkthrough can derail a closing, but they don’t have to. Here’s how to handle common conflicts:

### 1. Uncompleted Repairs

If a repair wasn’t done, refer to the written agreement. Your realtor can negotiate a credit, delay closing, or arrange for the repair to be completed post-closing with an escrow holdback.

### 2. New Damage

If new damage appears (e.g., water damage from a storm), document it with photos and notify your realtor. You may need to file an insurance claim or renegotiate with the seller.

### 3. Missing Fixtures

If an item included in the sale is missing, check the purchase agreement. Your realtor can request a replacement or credit.

### 4. Tenant Holdovers

In foreclosure cases, tenants may refuse to leave. Your realtor should coordinate with the seller or bank to resolve the issue, potentially delaying closing.

### 5. Utilities Off

If utilities are off, request the seller to restore them. If that’s not possible, negotiate a contingency to test systems post-closing.

My experience as a first responder turned realtor equips me to handle these disputes with calm and precision. Watch my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)) for real examples, and visit [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/negotiating-written-buyer-agreements-how-the-first-responder-realtor-protects](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/negotiating-written-buyer-agreements-how-the-first-responder-realtor-protects) for more on protecting your interests.

## The Impact of Market Trends on Final Walkthroughs

Santa Clarita’s market trends directly affect the final walkthrough. With inventory at a two-year high ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/505-the-highest-number-of-santa-clarita-real-estate-listings-in-over-two-years](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/505-the-highest-number-of-santa-clarita-real-estate-listings-in-over-two-years)), buyers have more leverage to be picky, while sellers need to ensure their property stands out. Here’s how market dynamics play a role:

	- **High Inventory**: More listings mean buyers can afford to scrutinize properties during walkthroughs, especially if they’re comparing multiple homes.

	- **Price Reductions**: Frequent price changes ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/price-changes-galore-in-the-santa-clarita-real-estate-world-mid-july-2024](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/price-changes-galore-in-the-santa-clarita-real-estate-world-mid-july-2024)) can make buyers suspicious, leading to closer inspections.

	- **Buyer Expectations**: In a competitive market, buyers expect repairs to be completed and the home to be in top condition.

Sellers can stay ahead by pricing competitively and preparing thoroughly. Buyers should use their leverage wisely, focusing on contract terms rather than new demands.

	- **Virtual Walkthroughs**: AI-powered 3D tours allow buyers to preview properties remotely, reducing surprises during the in-person walkthrough.

	- **Predictive Analytics**: AI analyzes market data to flag potential issues, like repair costs or pricing disputes, before the walkthrough.

	- **Document Management**: AI organizes repair agreements and escrow documents, ensuring all parties have access to critical information.

## Special Considerations for Unique Properties

Santa Clarita offers a variety of properties, from new constructions ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/new-construction-properties-for-sale-in-santa-clarita-ca](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/new-construction-properties-for-sale-in-santa-clarita-ca)) to 55+ community homes ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-in-a-55-community-for-sale-in-santa-clarita-ca](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-in-a-55-community-for-sale-in-santa-clarita-ca)). Each type has unique walkthrough considerations:

	- **New Constructions**: Verify that all systems (e.g., HVAC, plumbing) are installed and functional. Check for construction debris or incomplete finishes.

	- **Foreclosures**: Watch for tenant holdovers or neglected maintenance, as I discussed in my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)).

	- **55+ Communities**: Ensure amenities like community centers or pools are accessible and in good condition.

	- **Gated Homes**: Confirm gate access and security systems are operational.

	- **Condos and Townhomes**: Check common areas and HOA-related repairs ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/condominium-and-pud-ownership](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/condominium-and-pud-ownership)).

### First-Time Buyers

	- **Be Thorough**: Check every room and system, even if it feels tedious.

### First-Time Sellers

	- **Stage the Home**: A clean, empty home makes a great impression. Learn more at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/making-a-good-first-impression](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/making-a-good-first-impression).

	- **Document Repairs**: Keep records of all work done to avoid disputes.

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
