This 5000+ word guide covers everything from handling uncompleted repairs to navigating tenant holdovers in foreclosures. Watch my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)) for a quick overview.

## Introduction: Why the Final Walkthrough Is a Game-Changer in Santa Clarita Real Estate

Imagine you’re just days away from closing on your dream home in Santa Clarita—or you’re a seller ready to pass the keys to a new owner. Everything’s lined up perfectly: the offer’s accepted, the inspections are done, and escrow’s almost closed. Then, at the final walkthrough, you discover a promised repair wasn’t completed, or worse, a tenant refuses to leave. Suddenly, your smooth deal is teetering on the edge of chaos. That’s where the final walkthrough comes in—it’s your last chance to ensure everything’s as it should be before the deal is sealed.

As a former LAPD motor cop turned realtor (CALDRE 01238257), I’ve swapped high-speed chases for high-stakes real estate deals. My years of handling intense situations on the streets have sharpened my ability to spot issues and solve problems fast. In my recent YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)), I break down why the final walkthrough is your ultimate defense against costly surprises. This 5000+ word guide dives deeper, offering practical tips, real-world scenarios, and expert advice to navigate the final walkthrough in Santa Clarita’s competitive market.

Whether you’re buying a condo in Canyon Country (https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/blog/condos-for-sale-in-canyon-country-ca) or selling a luxury home in Stevenson Ranch ([https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/blog/homes-for-sale-in-stevenson-ranch-ca](/)), I’ve got your back. Let’s dive into the final walkthrough process and how to ace it like a pro.

## What Is a Final Walkthrough?

The final walkthrough is the buyer’s last opportunity to inspect a property before escrow closes, typically scheduled 24–48 hours before the closing date. It’s not a full home inspection—that happens earlier in the process—but a focused check to confirm the property is in the agreed-upon condition, all repairs are complete, and no new issues have surfaced. For sellers, it’s about proving you’ve met your contractual obligations, from leaving the home clean to ensuring utilities are on.

In my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)), I explain how the walkthrough catches issues like uncompleted repairs or unexpected tenants, particularly in foreclosure scenarios. In Santa Clarita, where inventory hit a record-breaking 505 active listings in July 2025 (https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/blog/505-the-highest-number-of-santa-clarita-real-estate-listings-in-over-two-years), a smooth walkthrough can keep your deal on track in this fast-paced market.

### Why It’s Critical

As a first responder turned realtor, I approach walkthroughs with the same precision I used in law enforcement—checking every detail to protect your interests.

## The Santa Clarita Real Estate Market: Setting the Stage

Santa Clarita’s real estate market is a wild ride, with high inventory levels creating opportunities for buyers and challenges for sellers. As of July 2025, we’re seeing over 505 active listings—the highest in over two years (https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/blog/505-the-highest-number-of-santa-clarita-real-estate-listings-in-over-two-years). This surge means buyers have more choices, from affordable condos in Valencia (https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/blog/condos-for-sale-in-valencia-ca) to gated homes in Saugus (https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/blog/gated-homes-for-sale-in-saugus-ca). For sellers, it’s a competitive landscape where a flawless final walkthrough can set you apart.

My YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)) gives a quick snapshot of what to expect during a walkthrough, but this guide dives into the details, covering everything from repairs to tenant issues. Whether you’re a first-time buyer or a seasoned seller, understanding the walkthrough process is key to closing with confidence.

## What to Expect During a Final Walkthrough in Santa Clarita

The final walkthrough typically lasts 30–60 minutes, depending on the property’s size and complexity. Here’s a breakdown of what buyers and sellers should anticipate:

### For Buyers

### For Sellers

### Common Issues During Walkthroughs

To avoid these pitfalls, work with a realtor who knows Santa Clarita’s market inside out. I’ve handled countless walkthroughs and can spot issues before they derail your deal. Contact me at 661-888-4983 or book a free consultation at [https://www.zoomescv.com/](https://www.zoomescv.com/).

## The Power of Written Agreements in Final Walkthroughs

As I mentioned in my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)), “either already been a disc about why it isn’t and that that particular issue as via some kind of writt the escrow process, usuall for repairs.” Written agreements are the backbone of a smooth walkthrough, ensuring clarity and accountability for both parties.

### Why Written Agreements Are Essential

For example, if a home inspection revealed dry rot in a window frame, the buyer and seller might agree in writing that the seller will repair it before closing. During the walkthrough, the buyer can verify the repair was completed to their satisfaction. Without a written agreement, disputes can escalate, delaying closing or leading to legal issues.

## Navigating Tenant Holdovers and Foreclosure Challenges

During the foreclosure wave, final walkthroughs could be a logistical nightmare. As I noted in my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)), “back in the day was kind o in the last foreclosure we would go through prope closing and those people tenants, they didn’t want weren’t going anywhere.” While tenant holdovers are less common today, they still occur, especially with investment properties or foreclosures listed on https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/blog/foreclosure-search.

## Real-World Final Walkthrough Scenarios in Santa Clarita

Let’s explore some common scenarios you might encounter during a final walkthrough in Santa Clarita, along with solutions:

### Scenario 1: Uncompleted Repairs

**Issue**: The seller agreed to fix a broken garage door, but it’s still malfunctioning during the walkthrough.

**Solution**: Document the issue with photos and notify your realtor immediately. You can request a credit, delay closing until the repair is complete, or renegotiate terms. A written repair agreement is crucial here.

### Scenario 2: Missing Fixtures

**Issue**: The seller removed a chandelier that was supposed to stay with the home.

**Solution**: Refer to the purchase agreement to confirm what was included in the sale. Your realtor can negotiate a replacement or credit. Learn more about purchase agreements at https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/blog/the-2024-residential-purchase-agreement-for-a-home-buyer-buying-real-estate.

### Scenario 3: Utilities Turned Off

**Issue**: The electricity is off, so you can’t test the appliances or HVAC system.

**Solution**: Contact the seller’s agent to have utilities turned back on. If this isn’t possible before closing, request a delay or a contingency to verify systems post-closing.

### Scenario 4: Tenant Holdover

**Issue**: A tenant is still living in the property and refuses to leave, as seen in foreclosure scenarios.

**Solution**: Coordinate with the seller or bank to initiate eviction proceedings. Delay closing until the property is vacant. My YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)) highlights this issue.

### Scenario 5: New Damage

**Issue**: You notice water damage from a recent storm that wasn’t present during the home inspection.

**Solution**: Document the damage and notify your realtor. You may need to file an insurance claim or renegotiate with the seller to cover repair costs.

These scenarios underscore the importance of working with a realtor who can handle unexpected challenges. My experience as a first responder turned realtor ensures quick, effective solutions.

## Pricing Strategies and Their Impact on the Final Walkthrough

In my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)), I touch on pricing misconceptions: “a little bit about quite pricing strategy because the misconception. Well, market, there’s going to going to be an issue.” Pricing your home correctly is crucial, as it influences buyer expectations and the scrutiny they bring to the final walkthrough.

## FAQs About Final Walkthroughs

For more FAQs, visit https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/blog/santa-clarita-real-estate-faqs.

## Common Misconceptions About Final Walkthroughs

There are several myths about final walkthroughs that can trip up buyers and sellers. Let’s debunk a few:

### Myth 1: The Walkthrough Is Just a Formality

**Reality**: The walkthrough is your last chance to catch issues before closing. Skipping it or rushing through can lead to costly oversights, like missing a broken HVAC system or uncompleted repairs.

### Myth 2: All Repairs Are Optional

**Reality**: If repairs are agreed upon in writing during escrow, they’re binding. As I noted in my YouTube Short ([https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/hRcTnL3vl0w?feature=share)), any issues not addressed should have been discussed and documented beforehand.

### Myth 3: Buyers Can Demand New Repairs

**Reality**: The walkthrough isn’t for identifying new issues—it’s for verifying agreed-upon conditions. New issues may require negotiation or insurance claims.

### Myth 4: Sellers Can Leave Personal Items

**Reality**: Unless specified in the contract, the home should be empty and clean. Leaving items behind can lead to disputes.

## How to Handle Disputes During the Final Walkthrough

Disputes during the final walkthrough can derail a closing, but they don’t have to. Here’s how to handle common conflicts:

### 1. Uncompleted Repairs

If a repair wasn’t done, refer to the written agreement. Your realtor can negotiate a credit, delay closing, or arrange for the repair to be completed post-closing with an escrow holdback.

### 2. New Damage

If new damage appears (e.g., water damage from a storm), document it with photos and notify your realtor. You may need to file an insurance claim or renegotiate with the seller.

### 3. Missing Fixtures

If an item included in the sale is missing, check the purchase agreement. Your realtor can request a replacement or credit.

### 4. Tenant Holdovers

In foreclosure cases, tenants may refuse to leave. Your realtor should coordinate with the seller or bank to resolve the issue, potentially delaying closing.

### 5. Utilities Off

If utilities are off, request the seller to restore them. If that’s not possible, negotiate a contingency to test systems post-closing.

My experience as a first responder turned realtor equips me to handle these disputes with calm and precision.

## The Impact of Market Trends on Final Walkthroughs

Santa Clarita’s market trends directly affect the final walkthrough. With inventory at a two-year high (https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/blog/505-the-highest-number-of-santa-clarita-real-estate-listings-in-over-two-years), buyers have more leverage to be picky, while sellers need to ensure their property stands out. Here’s how market dynamics play a role:

Sellers can stay ahead by pricing competitively and preparing thoroughly. Buyers should use their leverage wisely, focusing on contract terms rather than new demands. For the latest market insights, visit https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/blog/santa-clarita-real-estate-market-trends.
