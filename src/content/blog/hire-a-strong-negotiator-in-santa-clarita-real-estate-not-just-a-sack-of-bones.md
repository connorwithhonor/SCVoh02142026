### **Why Hiring a Strong Negotiator is Essential in Santa Clarita Real Estate**

In today’s Santa Clarita real estate market, having a strong, experienced agent isn’t just helpful—it’s essential. I'm Connor MacIvor, known as “Connor with Honor,” and as the First Responder Realtor, my mission is to serve and protect my clients' interests in the real estate world. Navigating the complexities of home buying and selling requires a specific skill set, and while there are many agents out there, not all of them can handle the demands of this market. Let’s dive into why a skilled negotiator is critical and why I make it my business to go the extra mile for my clients.

### **What a Strong Negotiator Brings to the Table in Santa Clarita**

Hiring a skilled negotiator means you have someone who’s prepared for all scenarios. In Santa Clarita, where the market is fluctuating and often competitive, negotiation skills can be the difference between a great deal and a missed opportunity. It’s not just about listing a home or putting in an offer; it’s about having someone who can stand up for your interests, counter unreasonable demands, and bring rationality to an emotional process.

#### **Understanding Lowball Offers and Market Adjustments**

One of the first questions I get from sellers is about lowball offers. Should they consider them? Should they reject them? Here’s the truth: every offer must be weighed against the current market reality. If the agent representing the buyer is not also the listing agent, then rejecting low offers can often work in the seller's favor, as it reinforces the value of the home.

But if the same agent represents both parties, they need to have written permission from the seller to disregard certain offers. This helps protect the seller’s position and ensures there’s a clear boundary for what’s acceptable.

In today’s Santa Clarita market, we’re experiencing a period of adjustment. Listing prices are still high, influenced by expectations of rate drops, but in reality, the market is cooling. When homes linger on the market, it’s often not due to lack of demand but to unrealistic pricing. Sellers need to understand that their home will ultimately sell for what the market will bear, no more, no less. My role as your agent is to guide you through this with transparency and honesty, presenting you with data and comparisons to support every decision.

### **Standing Up for My Clients: Real-Life Negotiation Examples**

Over the years, I’ve had my share of negotiations where standing up for my clients has been the priority. Let’s explore a few examples that illustrate the difference a strong negotiator can make.

#### **Example 1: The “Repair Request Rundown”**

Imagine you’re a buyer who’s fallen in love with a property, but the inspection reveals some issues. Now, repair requests are part of the process, but they’re often mishandled. Too many agents submit vague, inflated requests without clear justifications, which can lead to unnecessary friction.

When I represent buyers, I take the time to review the inspection report with my client, identifying critical issues that should be addressed and putting together a clear, itemized request for repairs. I don’t stop there. I provide a breakdown of estimated costs from professionals in my network—home inspectors, plumbers, and electricians—so the request is grounded in reality.

This organized, transparent approach is something sellers respect. When a repair request looks like an attempt to “pull extra money,” it weakens our negotiating position. I make sure to avoid this by being thorough and providing every piece of evidence a seller needs to understand why the repair matters. This makes negotiations smoother and increases the chance of getting what my buyer truly needs​(Hiring a stong negotiat…).

#### **Example 2: Shielding Sellers from Unreasonable Demands**

On the flip side, when I represent a seller, I approach repair requests with a critical eye. Recently, I worked with a seller in Santa Clarita who received a repair request from a buyer asking for a “general repair fund” without itemized details. This is unprofessional and often signals a buyer trying to renegotiate terms post-offer. I stood firm, explaining that without valid estimates and documentation, we wouldn’t entertain the request.

When a buyer’s agent provided specific repair costs that were unjustified, I went one step further: I arranged for independent evaluations, which confirmed that the costs were inflated. By countering with our documented, fair estimates, we were able to close the deal without unnecessary concessions. This approach saved my client thousands and preserved their bottom line.

### **The Importance of Knowing the Market Intimately**

In Santa Clarita, the market shifts quickly, and what worked last year might not work today. Having an agent who knows the pulse of the market can provide a significant edge. For example, I make it a priority to keep up with weekly market data, examining new listings, price adjustments, and closed sales. This information tells us what buyers are willing to pay, what sellers are offering, and where negotiation opportunities lie.

For sellers, I leverage this data to set realistic, competitive prices. Listing too high only leads to eventual price cuts, which can tarnish a listing’s appeal. By pricing right from the start, we attract serious buyers and avoid unnecessary adjustments.

### **Transparency and Communication: The Hallmarks of a Strong Agent**

Being a great negotiator isn’t just about holding firm; it’s about communicating clearly. My clients know I’ll provide them with all the information they need to make an informed decision. When lowball offers come in, or when buyers ask for unreasonable repairs, I break down the numbers and explain why certain requests may or may not align with the current market conditions.

For buyers, transparency means discussing not just the costs but the implications of certain repairs or upgrades. I provide insights into which repairs will impact the home’s value long-term and which are simply cosmetic fixes. This clarity ensures that my clients never feel pressured but always feel prepared.

### **Why I’m Called the First Responder Realtor**

As a former first responder, my background has given me a unique perspective on what it means to be a strong advocate. I don’t back down when things get tough, and I don’t let emotions steer my negotiations. When the market is challenging, and other agents are backing away, I step in to ensure my clients’ interests are always the priority.

Santa Clarita homeowners and buyers deserve a realtor who will go above and beyond, someone who will approach every deal with diligence, fairness, and a relentless commitment to getting the best results. That’s what it means to be Connor with Honor.
