**Valencia, Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Update – October 15, 2024**

Good day, everyone! I’m **First Responder Realtor Connor with Honor**, here to protect and serve your real estate needs in the Santa Clarita Valley. Whether you’re buying, selling, or just keeping an eye on the market, I’ve got you covered with today’s Valencia real estate update.

My goal? **Saving the world, one honest home sale at a time**, ensuring you make informed decisions every step of the way.

### Market Snapshot for Valencia and Santa Clarita:

The housing market in Valencia is moving quickly, with plenty of opportunities for both buyers and sellers. Here’s what’s happening as of today:

	- **Coming Soon Listings**: **8** homes are preparing to hit the market, and with a little preparation, you could be the first to see them! Be sure to set up a search with your agent.

	- **New Listings**: **81** new properties have entered the market, giving buyers a fresh pool of options to consider.

	- **Price Changes**: **70** homes have had price adjustments, a sign that sellers are fine-tuning their expectations in response to the shifting market. This could be the perfect time to snag a deal, so don’t hesitate to take a closer look at those homes.

	- **Back on Market**: **26** properties are back after falling out of escrow. This often happens due to financing issues rather than anything wrong with the property itself, so don’t overlook these second chances.

	- **Pending Sales**: **42** properties are currently pending, just a few steps away from closing.

	- **Active Under Contract**: **29** homes are under contract but still accepting backup offers. If you've had your eye on one of these, now’s the time to stay sharp.

	- **Closed Sales**: **50** homes have officially sold in the past week—congratulations to the new homeowners!

	- **Expired Listings**: **3** properties didn’t sell during their listing period, while **15** were canceled by sellers.

	- **Hold/Withdrawn Listings**: **10** homes are on hold, and **4** have been withdrawn from the market altogether.

All in all, the **total active residential inventory** for Santa Clarita’s single-family homes sits at **547** listings, giving buyers and sellers plenty of opportunities.

### Spotlight on Valencia’s Diverse Neighborhoods

Valencia continues to be one of the most desirable areas in the Santa Clarita Valley. Whether you're looking for a charming older home in **Northbridge** or **Old Orchard**, or something modern and sleek in **West Creek** or **Tesoro del Valle**, Valencia offers a wide range of options. The balance of suburban living with proximity to great schools, parks, and local amenities is why so many families and professionals are drawn to the area.

	- 
	**Belcaro**: Looking for luxury in a 55+ community? Belcaro is a prestigious gated neighborhood with homes like a stunning property listed just under $850,000. Resort-like amenities, including a clubhouse, swimming pool, and pickleball courts, make this an ideal spot for those seeking both comfort and an active lifestyle.

### **First Responder Realtor Tip: Don’t Sign Blindly**

Today’s **buyer tip** comes straight from my experience protecting the public, both as a first responder and as a realtor. Before you click to sign anything online—**especially** real estate documents—make sure you understand everything you’re agreeing to. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement, but one click could bind you to terms you didn’t expect.

Take the time to review each document carefully. If something is unclear, don’t hesitate to ask your agent for clarification. Real estate is too important to leave anything to chance.

### Open House Season is Heating Up

As we head into the weekend, Santa Clarita is seeing a significant uptick in open houses. Right now, **21 open houses** are scheduled, but as we move closer to the weekend, that number is expected to climb to **160 or more**. Don’t miss your chance to tour some incredible homes in the area!
