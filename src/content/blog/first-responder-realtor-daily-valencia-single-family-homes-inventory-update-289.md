### **First Responder Realtor Tip: Don’t Sign Blindly**

Today’s **buyer tip** comes straight from my experience protecting the public, both as a first responder and as a realtor. Before you click to sign anything online—**especially** real estate documents—make sure you understand everything you’re agreeing to. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement, but one click could bind you to terms you didn’t expect.

Take the time to review each document carefully. If something is unclear, don’t hesitate to ask your agent for clarification. Real estate is too important to leave anything to chance.
