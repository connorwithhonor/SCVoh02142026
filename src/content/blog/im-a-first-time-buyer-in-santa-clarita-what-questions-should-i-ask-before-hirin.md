## TL;DR

First-time buyers in Santa Clarita need to interview agents like they're hiring for the most important job of their life—because they are. Ask about response times, communication plans, negotiation experience, local market knowledge, commission structures (post-NAR settlement rules in 2026), and whether they'll show you EVERY home in your budget or just the ones that pay them more. Red flags include agents who can't explain their strategy, refuse to provide references, or pressure you to sign without reading the buyer broker agreement. Connor MacIvor, a former LAPD officer turned Santa Clarita realtor, provides the exact questions to ask, what answers to expect, and how to avoid hiring an agent who's working for their paycheck instead of your best interests.

## The Conversation That Sets You Up for Success (Or Disaster)

**You:** I've never bought a home before. I found an agent online who seems nice. Should I just go with them?

**Connor:** Hold on. "Nice" doesn't mean competent. Before you sign anything, you need to interview them like you're hiring them for a job—because you are. This person will handle the biggest financial transaction of your life. Would you hire an employee without asking about their experience, work style, and track record?

**You:** I guess not. But what should I even ask? I don't know what I don't know.

**Connor:** Exactly. That's why most first-time buyers hire the wrong agent—they don't know what questions to ask. Let me give you a framework. By the end of this conversation, you'll know exactly how to interview agents and spot the red flags.

**You:** Okay, where do I start?

**Connor:** Start with the most important question: "How will you communicate with me throughout this process?"

## The 15 Questions Every First-Time Buyer Must Ask Before Hiring a Santa Clarita Agent

### Question 1: "What's Your Communication Plan?"

**Why this matters:** Poor communication is the #1 complaint buyers have about their agents. You need to know upfront how often you'll hear from them and how quickly they'll respond.

**What a good agent says:** "I respond to calls and texts within 4-6 hours during business hours and within 24 hours on evenings and weekends. I'll send you new listings every day that match your criteria, and we'll have a weekly check-in call to adjust strategy. If I'm unavailable, my assistant [name] will be your backup contact."

**Red flags:**

	- "I'll stay in touch" (vague, no specifics)

	- "I'm pretty good about responding" (no commitment)

	- "Just text me whenever" (no structure or accountability)

**Follow-up question:** "Can we put this communication plan in writing as part of our buyer broker agreement?"

If they hesitate or say it's not necessary, walk away. A professional agent will have no problem documenting their commitments.

### Question 2: "How Many First-Time Buyers Have You Worked With in Santa Clarita in the Past 12 Months?"

**Why this matters:** First-time buyers need education and patience. An agent who specializes in investors or luxury homes may not have the skills (or patience) to guide you through the process.

**What a good agent says:** "I've worked with 8-12 first-time buyers in the past year. Here's what makes first-time buyers different: you need more hand-holding during inspections, you're learning the process as we go, and you may need help understanding loan options. I enjoy that aspect of the job and build extra time into my schedule for education."

**Red flags:**

	- "I mostly work with investors, but I can help you too" (you're not their priority)

	- "I haven't worked with many first-timers, but it's all the same" (it's not)

	- "Everyone's my specialty" (nobody's actually their specialty)

**Follow-up question:** "Can you give me 2-3 references from first-time buyers you've worked with in [Valencia/Saugus/Canyon Country]?"

If they can't provide references, that's a major red flag.

### Question 3: "What Neighborhoods in Santa Clarita Do You Specialize In?"

**Why this matters:** Santa Clarita has distinct neighborhoods with different price points, school districts, HOA structures, and Mello-Roos fees. An agent who "covers the whole valley" probably doesn't know any area deeply.

**What a good agent says:** "I focus primarily on [Valencia, Saugus, Stevenson Ranch, Canyon Country], and I can speak to the pros and cons of each. For example, [Valencia](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-valencia-ca) has newer homes and top-rated schools, but you'll pay Mello-Roos. [Saugus](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-saugus-ca) has older homes with no Mello-Roos, which saves you $200-$400/month. Let's talk about your priorities so I can recommend the best fit."

**Red flags:**

	- "I work all over LA County" (too broad, no local expertise)

	- "Wherever you want to buy is fine with me" (no strategic guidance)

	- Can't explain the differences between neighborhoods

**Follow-up question:** "What are the Mello-Roos fees in [specific neighborhood]?"

If they don't know or say "we'll figure that out later," they're not prepared. A good agent knows this off the top of their head.

### Question 4: "How Will You Help Me Determine My Budget?"

**Why this matters:** Most first-time buyers get pre-approved for MORE than they can actually afford. A good agent will help you calculate your TRUE monthly cost (mortgage + property taxes + Mello-Roos + HOA + insurance + maintenance).

**What a good agent says:** "Before we look at any homes, I'll sit down with you and build a complete budget. We'll factor in your mortgage payment, property taxes, Mello-Roos (if applicable), HOA fees, insurance, and a maintenance reserve. I want to make sure you're comfortable with the payment and not house-poor. I'd rather you buy a $650K home and sleep well at night than stretch to $750K and stress about every bill."

**Red flags:**

	- "Your lender will tell you what you can afford" (lazy, no guidance)

	- "You're pre-approved for $800K, so let's look at $800K homes" (ignoring your actual budget comfort)

	- Doesn't mention Mello-Roos, HOA fees, or other hidden costs

**Follow-up question:** "Can you help me understand the difference between what I'm pre-approved for and what I should actually spend?"

A good agent will say yes and walk you through the math. A bad agent will push you to spend the maximum.

### Question 5: "What's Your Strategy for Finding Homes Before They Hit the Market?"

**Why this matters:** In Santa Clarita's competitive market (especially in [Valencia](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/valencia-market-report) and [Stevenson Ranch](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-stevenson-ranch-ca)), many homes sell before they're widely advertised. You need an agent with off-market access.

**What a good agent says:** "I monitor 'coming soon' listings through the MLS, I have relationships with other agents who give me early access to listings, and I send daily email alerts to my buyers so they see homes before they're on Zillow. I also attend broker previews and open houses to scout properties for my clients."

**Red flags:**

	- "Just search Zillow and send me what you like" (you're doing their job)

	- "Homes hit the market when they hit the market" (no proactive strategy)

	- No mention of MLS alerts, coming soon listings, or agent relationships

**Follow-up question:** "Can you show me an example of a recent buyer you helped who found a home before it was publicly listed?"

If they can't provide an example, they don't actually have off-market access.

### Question 6: "What's Your Negotiation Strategy?"

**Why this matters:** First-time buyers often overpay because their agent doesn't know how to negotiate. You need someone who will fight for every dollar.

**What a good agent says:** "My negotiation strategy starts with data. I pull comparable sales (comps) to justify our offer price. If the seller counters, I don't just accept it—I show you the data and we decide together if it makes sense. I also negotiate repairs, closing costs, and contingencies. My goal is to get you the best deal, even if it means walking away from a home that's overpriced."

**Red flags:**

	- "We'll just offer asking price to be competitive" (no strategy)

	- "Sellers aren't negotiating in this market" (weak, defeatist attitude)

	- "I'll handle the negotiations, don't worry about it" (no transparency)

**Follow-up question:** "Can you walk me through a recent deal where you saved a buyer money through negotiation?"

A good agent will have multiple examples. A bad agent will get defensive or change the subject.

### Question 7: "How Do You Handle Multiple Offer Situations?"

**Why this matters:** In Santa Clarita, many homes receive multiple offers. You need an agent who can make your offer stand out without overpaying.

**What a good agent says:** "In multiple offer situations, I focus on terms, not just price. We can offer a faster close, waive certain contingencies (if it's safe to do so), or include an escalation clause. I also write a strong pre-approval letter and a personal letter from you to the seller. My goal is to make our offer as attractive as possible while protecting you from overpaying."

**Red flags:**

	- "We'll just offer $50K over asking to win" (no strategy, just throwing money)

	- "There's nothing we can do, it's a seller's market" (lazy, defeatist)

	- Doesn't mention non-price terms or creative strategies

**Follow-up question:** "Have you ever won a multiple offer situation without being the highest bidder?"

If yes, ask them to explain how. If no, they're not a strong negotiator.

### Question 8: "What Happens If I Want to Back Out of a Deal?"

**Why this matters:** First-time buyers get cold feet. You need to know your exit options before you're in escrow.

**What a good agent says:** "You have several contingency periods where you can back out without penalty: loan contingency (typically 21 days), inspection contingency (17 days), and appraisal contingency (17 days). If you decide the home isn't right during these windows, we can cancel and you'll get your deposit back. After contingencies are removed, backing out is more complicated—you could lose your deposit or even get sued by the seller. I'll make sure you're 100% confident before we remove any contingencies."

**Red flags:**

	- "Once you sign, you're committed" (not true during contingencies)

	- "Don't worry about it, you'll love the home" (dismissive of legitimate concerns)

	- Can't explain contingency periods or cancellation rights

**Follow-up question:** "What's the latest I can back out without losing my deposit?"

A good agent will explain contingency timelines in detail. A bad agent will gloss over this.

### Question 9: "How Much Will This Cost Me, and How Do You Get Paid?"

**Why this matters:** Post-NAR settlement (effective August 2024, still in effect in 2026), buyer's agent commissions are negotiable and must be disclosed upfront. You need to know exactly what you're paying.

**What a good agent says:** "My standard fee is [2.5% of purchase price / flat fee / hourly rate]. This is negotiable based on the services you need. For example, if you want full service (home search, showings, negotiation, escrow management), that's one price. If you only need help with negotiations, I can offer a lower rate. Everything will be documented in our [buyer broker agreement](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/buyers-guide) before we start working together."

**Red flags:**

	- "The seller pays my commission, so it's free for you" (outdated, misleading)

	- "We'll figure that out later" (no transparency)

	- Refuses to discuss fees upfront

**Follow-up question:** "Can I see a sample buyer broker agreement before I commit?"

If they say no or get defensive, walk away. Transparency is non-negotiable.

### Question 10: "Will You Show Me EVERY Home That Fits My Criteria?"

**Why this matters:** Some agents steer buyers toward listings that pay higher commissions or are easier to sell. This is unethical and illegal.

**What a good agent says:** "Absolutely. I'll show you every home in your price range and preferred neighborhoods, regardless of commission. My job is to find YOU the right home, not to maximize my paycheck. If a home fits your criteria, we'll tour it."

**Red flags:**

	- "Some homes aren't worth your time" (without valid reason)

	- Avoids certain listings or neighborhoods

	- Prioritizes homes from their own brokerage

**Follow-up question:** "How do you decide which homes to show me?"

A good agent will say: "Based on your criteria (price, location, size, condition)." A bad agent will give evasive answers.

### Question 11: "Do You Work With a Team, or Will I Be Working Directly With You?"

**Why this matters:** Some agents delegate everything to assistants. You need to know who you'll actually be interacting with.

**What a good agent says:** "I work with a small team. My assistant [name] handles scheduling and administrative tasks, but I personally attend all showings, negotiations, and inspections. You'll always have direct access to me, and my team ensures nothing falls through the cracks."

**Red flags:**

	- "I have a team that handles most of it" (you'll never see them)

	- "I'm a solo agent and I do everything myself" (may be overwhelmed and unresponsive)

	- Can't explain who does what

**Follow-up question:** "If I call you on a Saturday, who will answer?"

A good agent will have a clear plan. A bad agent will say "leave a message."

### Question 12: "What's Your Backup Plan If You're Unavailable?"

**Why this matters:** Agents get sick, go on vacation, and have emergencies. You need to know who steps in when they're unavailable.

**What a good agent says:** "If I'm unavailable, my partner agent [name] will cover for me. They have access to all your information and can handle showings, answer questions, and submit offers. You'll have their contact info from Day 1."

**Red flags:**

	- "I'm always available" (unrealistic, no backup plan)

	- "Just wait until I'm back" (no coverage)

	- Can't name a specific backup person

### Question 13: "How Do You Handle Inspection Issues?"

**Why this matters:** Almost every home has issues found during inspection. You need an agent who can navigate repair negotiations without blowing up the deal.

**What a good agent says:** "After the inspection, I'll help you categorize issues into three buckets: (1) deal-breakers (major structural or safety issues), (2) negotiable repairs (roof, HVAC, plumbing), and (3) cosmetic items we can live with. We'll prioritize the big stuff and negotiate repairs or credits from the seller. My goal is to get you a fair deal without scaring the seller away."

**Red flags:**

	- "The seller won't fix anything, so don't bother asking" (weak negotiator)

	- "We'll ask for everything" (unrealistic, may kill the deal)

	- Doesn't explain the process clearly

**Follow-up question:** "Can you give me an example of a recent inspection where you negotiated repairs?"

A good agent will have multiple examples.

### Question 14: "What Happens After We Close?"

**Why this matters:** Some agents disappear after closing. You need someone who's available for post-closing questions and referrals (contractors, insurance, etc.).

**What a good agent says:** "After closing, I check in with you at 30 days, 90 days, and annually to see how you're settling in. If you need referrals for contractors, landscapers, or home services, I have a vetted list. And if you ever decide to sell, I'm here to help with that too."

**Red flags:**

	- "My job ends at closing" (transactional, no relationship)

	- No mention of follow-up or support

	- Can't provide contractor referrals

### Question 15: "Why Should I Hire You Over Another Agent?"

**Why this matters:** This is the ultimate test. A confident, experienced agent will have a clear, compelling answer. A weak agent will fumble.

**What a good agent says:** "You should hire me because I specialize in first-time buyers in Santa Clarita, I have a proven track record (here are my references), I communicate clearly and frequently, and I'll educate you throughout the process so you feel confident in every decision. I don't just find you a house—I make sure you understand what you're buying and why it's the right choice."

**Red flags:**

	- "I'm the best" (no specifics, just ego)

	- "I work harder than other agents" (vague, unverifiable)

	- Can't articulate what makes them different

## FAQ: First-Time Buyer Questions About Hiring an Agent in 2026

### Q: Do I legally need an agent to buy a home in Santa Clarita?

**A:** No, but going without one is risky. Real estate contracts are complex, and one mistake can cost you thousands. Even if you're buying a home "for sale by owner," having a buyer's agent protects you. And in 2026, under post-NAR rules, you negotiate agent fees upfront—so you control costs.

### Q: Can I interview multiple agents before choosing one?

**A:** Yes, and you should. Interview at least 3 agents. Compare their communication styles, experience, and fees. Don't hire the first agent you meet just because they're "nice."

### Q: What if I don't like my agent after we start working together?

**A:** Review your buyer broker agreement. Most agreements have a termination clause. If your agent isn't performing, document the issues and request termination. Contact their broker if necessary.

### Q: Should I use the listing agent as my buyer's agent to save money?

**A:** No. This is called dual agency, and it creates conflicts of interest. The listing agent represents the seller's interests. You need your own agent who works ONLY for you.

### Q: How do I know if an agent is steering me toward certain homes?

**A:** Ask directly: "Are you showing me EVERY home in my budget, or are you filtering based on commission?" If they're evasive, that's a red flag. A good agent shows you everything.

### Q: Can I negotiate my agent's commission in 2026?

**A:** Yes. Post-NAR settlement, all commissions are negotiable. Discuss fees upfront and get everything in writing in your buyer broker agreement.

### Q: What if I find a home on Zillow that my agent hasn't shown me?

**A:** Ask them why. There may be a valid reason (home is under contract, has major issues, etc.). But if they're consistently missing homes you're finding on your own, they're not doing their job.

### Q: Should I hire a friend or family member who's a real estate agent?

**A:** Only if they're experienced in Santa Clarita and specialize in first-time buyers. Hiring friends/family can create awkward situations if they're not performing. Treat it like a business decision.

### Q: How do I verify an agent's track record?

**A:** Ask for recent sales data in your target neighborhoods. Check reviews on Google, Yelp, and [testimonials](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/testimonials). Request references from past clients. A legitimate agent will have no problem providing proof.

### Q: What if my agent pressures me to make an offer?

**A:** Push back. Ask: "Why is this the right home for me?" and "What are the downsides?" If they can't justify the pressure with data, it's a red flag. You're in control, not them.

## How Connor MacIvor (Former LAPD) Helps First-Time Buyers Succeed

I spent 20 years on the streets of Los Angeles as an LAPD officer. I learned to stay calm under pressure, read people, and protect those who couldn't protect themselves. Now I bring those skills to real estate.

Here's how I help first-time buyers:

### 1. I Educate Before I Sell

Most agents rush you into making offers. I take time upfront to explain the entire process: pre-approval, home search, inspections, escrow, closing. You'll know what to expect at every step.

### 2. I Build a Real Budget (Not Just What the Lender Says)

I calculate your TRUE monthly cost, including [Mello-Roos](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/real-estate-glossary), HOA fees, insurance, and maintenance. I'd rather you buy a $600K home comfortably than stretch to $700K and regret it.

### 3. I Show You EVERY Home in Your Budget

No steering. No games. If it fits your criteria, we'll tour it—whether it's in [Valencia](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-valencia-ca), [Saugus](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-saugus-ca), [Canyon Country](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-canyon-country-ca), or [Castaic](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-castaic-ca).

### 4. I Negotiate Like a Cop (Because I Was One)

I went through LAPD hostage negotiation training. I know how to create leverage, build rapport, and close deals without leaving money on the table.

### 5. I'm Available (With Backup)

I respond within 4-6 hours during business hours. If I'm unavailable, my team has you covered. You'll never wonder where your agent is.

## Summary: The 15 Questions Every First-Time Buyer Must Ask

	- What's your communication plan?

	- How many first-time buyers have you worked with in Santa Clarita in the past 12 months?

	- What neighborhoods do you specialize in?

	- How will you help me determine my budget?

	- What's your strategy for finding homes before they hit the market?

	- What's your negotiation strategy?

	- How do you handle multiple offer situations?

	- What happens if I want to back out of a deal?

	- How much will this cost me, and how do you get paid?

	- Will you show me EVERY home that fits my criteria?

	- Do you work with a team, or will I be working directly with you?

	- What's your backup plan if you're unavailable?

	- How do you handle inspection issues?

	- What happens after we close?

	- Why should I hire you over another agent?

If an agent can't answer these questions clearly and confidently, keep looking.

## Final Thoughts: Don't Settle for "Good Enough"

Buying your first home is a big deal. You deserve an agent who educates, communicates, and fights for you—not someone who's just collecting a commission.
