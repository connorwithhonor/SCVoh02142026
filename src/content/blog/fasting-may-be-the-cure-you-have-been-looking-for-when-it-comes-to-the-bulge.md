# Fasting may be the cure you have been looking for when it comes to the bulge

## The Power of Fasting: Unlocking Your Body's Natural Healing and Fat-Burning Potential

Hello, Connor with Honor here, and I'm thrilled by the fantastic feedback from last week's show! It's clear that topics around health, longevity, and personal transformation resonate deeply with many of you. Today, I want to dive into a subject that has personally been a game-changer for me on my "Fat to Fit" journey: the incredible benefits of fasting and how it can empower your body to heal, burn fat, and boost your overall well-being.

My own experience, where I dropped 135 pounds of fat, is a testament to the power of longer-term and intermittent fasting. But it's not just my story; there's a growing body of scientific data that supports what our ancestors intuitively knew.

### Understanding the Fasting Phenomenon

Many people associate "fasting" with deprivation, but let's reframe it. The word "breakfast" itself literally means "break fast" – it's simply the meal where you break your overnight fast. Our bodies are designed for periods without food, a concept that was a natural part of human existence before the agricultural revolution and the constant availability of food.

When you intentionally go without food for certain periods, a remarkable process called **autophagy** kicks in. Autophagy is your body's natural cellular cleansing mechanism. Think of it as a deep internal spring cleaning, where your body starts to eat up old, damaged, or malignant cells, along with malformed skin and other issues. This isn't about starvation; it's about optimizing your cellular health and efficiency.

### The Science Behind the Hunger Waves and Metabolism

You might wonder about hunger. The hunger hormone, ghrelin, operates in waves. You're often hungriest at the times you normally eat – that breakfast peak, then perhaps around noon or dinner. These waves typically last 30-60 minutes. But here’s the fascinating part: the longer you fast, the more ghrelin starts to subside, and those hunger peaks become less intense.

One common misconception about fasting is that it slows down your metabolism, similar to traditional caloric restriction. This is a crucial distinction. With typical caloric restriction, your body quickly adapts by reducing its caloric burn, making weight loss harder and often leading to weight regain once you return to normal eating.

However, with fasting, a whole different dynamic unfolds. Your metabolism actually *increases*! Why? Because your body thinks it's in a state of scarcity and wants you to be energetic and sharp to "hunt" for your next meal. This evolutionary process means your body ramps up its metabolic rate, allowing you to more efficiently target and burn stored body fat.

### Ketosis: Fueling Your Body Differently

For those new to fasting, or looking to make it easier, transitioning into a state of **ketosis** can be incredibly beneficial. Ketosis is when your body, instead of relying on carbohydrates (sugar) as its primary fuel source, switches to burning fat. You produce ketones, which are an overage of fat being burned.

If you've already cut down on carbohydrates (e.g., through a ketogenic diet) before starting a fast, your body has already made that major fuel system shift from being a sugar-burner to a fat-burner. This often makes the initial period of fasting much smoother, reducing the stress that can come from that metabolic transition.

### Sparing Muscle and Boosting Growth Hormone

Another concern many people have about fasting is muscle loss. This is another misconception that the science clearly addresses. Fasting triggers a significant release of **human growth hormone (HGH)**. Studies have shown increases of 2000-3000% in HGH, which plays a vital role in preserving muscle tissue.

Think about our ancestors: if our bodies attacked essential muscle tissue during periods without food, humanity wouldn't have survived. Muscle is crucial for fighting, hunting, and basic survival. Your body is smart; it's designed to go after stored fat and problematic cells first, sparing vital muscle tissue.

### Practical Steps for Incorporating Fasting

So, how do you start? You don't need to jump into a 40-day fast like Ed Brown, whose incredible story I shared last week. Start small and listen to your body:

	- **Miss a Meal or Two:** Gradually extend the time between meals.

	- **Gradual Progression:** Once comfortable, try a longer fast. For example, going from Sunday night after your last meal to Tuesday morning for your first meal (your "break fast") would be a 32-36 hour fast. This is a great way to introduce your body to longer periods without food.

	- **Honor Your Food:** When you do eat, practice mindful eating. Chew your food thoroughly (50-60 times per bite, as some studies suggest) and savor each bite. Put your fork down between bites. This ensures better nutrient absorption and helps you feel satisfied.

	- **Listen to Your Body's Repair Mode:** When your digestive system isn't constantly working, your body shifts into repair mode. Just like an injured animal resting to heal, fasting allows your system to repair and rejuvenate.

### The Pitfalls of Constant Sweetness and the Importance of Research

Beyond just *when* you eat, *what* you consume plays a huge role. Constant consumption of artificial sweeteners or sugary drinks keeps your dopamine system constantly "ramped up." This can desensitize your reward pathways, making it harder to feel the natural satisfaction and dopamine release from creative endeavors, problem-solving, or building a business. Plain water is your friend!

Finally, always remember to do your research. The information is out there, thanks to large language models and tools like ChatGPT. But just as I ensure the AI systems I build for real estate businesses are based on true scientific data, you must verify your sources. Look for studies, understand who funded them, and consider their potential biases. Prioritize research that genuinely promotes health, fitness, and longevity. And, of course, always **consult your doctor before making any significant changes to your diet, exercise, or health regimen, especially if you are on medication.**

My personal journey is a testament to what's possible. It might feel uncomfortable at first, but the rewards of sharpened senses, increased energy, and significant health improvements are well worth it.
