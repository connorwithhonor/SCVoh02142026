## The Biggest Mistake Home Buyers Make: Starting in the Wrong Place

  
    
  

So, you’re ready to buy a home in Santa Clarita. You’re scrolling through listings on [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/), dreaming of a gated community in Valencia or a cozy condo in Saugus. But where do you actually *start*? Conventional wisdom screams, “Talk to a lender first!” Get pre-approved, know your budget, blah, blah, blah. Sure, that’s not terrible advice, but let me hit you with a truth bomb: **starting with a real estate agent is often the smarter move**.

Why? Because a good realtor—like yours truly, Connor MacIvor, who’s navigated the streets as an LAPD officer and now conquers the Santa Clarita real estate market—knows the entire playing field. We’re not just talking homes for sale; we’re talking strategy, connections, and the insider knowledge to keep you from getting screwed over. Lenders are great for numbers, but realtors are your generals in the home-buying war. Let’s break it down.

## Why a Realtor Should Be Your First Call

### 1. They Know the Players in the Game

A top-tier real estate agent isn’t just a glorified tour guide showing you pretty houses. They’re your personal quarterback, calling the plays and connecting you with the right team. Want to know the difference between a mortgage broker, a credit union, or a big bank? A realtor can break it down in plain English, no jargon, no fluff. For example:

	- **Mortgage Brokers**: These folks shop around for you, comparing rates from multiple lenders. They’re like the deal-hunters of the lending world, but you need to know which ones are legit. Check out [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/types-of-mortgage-lenders](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/types-of-mortgage-lenders) for a deeper dive.

	- **Credit Unions**: Often offer lower rates and more personalized service, but they might have stricter membership rules.

	- **Mainline Banks**: Big names you know, but they can be rigid and sometimes pricier.

A realtor like me, with years of experience in Santa Clarita, can point you to trusted lenders who won’t waste your time or sneak in hidden fees. I’ve seen the good, the bad, and the ugly in this market, and I’ll steer you toward the good. Want to explore your options? Hit up [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/the-advantages-of-different-types-of-mortgage-lenders](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/the-advantages-of-different-types-of-mortgage-lenders) for more insights.

### 2. They Arm You with the Right Questions

Walking into a lender’s office without prep is like walking into a car dealership with a blank check. You’re begging to be taken for a ride. A realtor will coach you on what to ask lenders to get the best deal. Questions like:

	- What’s the true cost of this loan, including fees and points?

	- Are there prepayment penalties?

	- How does this loan compare to others for my credit profile?

A good realtor doesn’t just hand you a lender’s business card; they give you the playbook to negotiate like a pro. For more on what you need to apply for a loan, check out [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/items-you-need-when-applying-for-a-loan](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/items-you-need-when-applying-for-a-loan).

### 3. They Understand the New Rules of the Game

Here’s where things get spicy. New real estate regulations in 2024 mean buyers might have to pay their agent’s commission directly. Yeah, you heard that right—buyers paying agents. It’s always been negotiable, but now it’s front and center. A savvy realtor will walk you through this, explaining how to negotiate commissions and avoid overpaying. Curious about these changes? Dive into [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/buyers-signing-contracts-to-just-view-homes-for-sale-is-now-mandatory](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/buyers-signing-contracts-to-just-view-homes-for-sale-is-now-mandatory) for the full scoop.

This is where my background as a first responder comes in. As an ex-LAPD officer, I’m trained to spot red flags and protect my clients. I’ll make sure you understand every contract, every fee, and every clause before you sign. No surprises, no scams—just results. Want to know more about buyer agreements?

### 4. They Keep You Safe from Shady Relationships

Here’s a dirty little secret: some lenders and agents have cozy “referral” deals that aren’t in your best interest. Maybe the lender pushes a high-rate loan because they get a kickback, or the agent refers you to their buddy who’s more about closing fast than closing smart. A realtor with integrity—like me—will vet every recommendation to ensure there’s no funny business. I’ve spent years building a network of trustworthy pros in Santa Clarita, from lenders to inspectors. You can trust me to keep it real. Learn more about avoiding scams at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/daily-santa-clarita-real-estate-update-buyers-dont-get-scammed-when-signing](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/daily-santa-clarita-real-estate-update-buyers-dont-get-scammed-when-signing).

## But What About Starting with a Lender?

Okay, let’s give the other side some love. Starting with a lender isn’t a terrible idea. Getting pre-approved gives you a clear budget, which is crucial in a hot market like Santa Clarita, where homes in neighborhoods like Valencia and Stevenson Ranch are getting multiple offers (see [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-real-estate-multiple-offers-on-most-homes-placed-on-the-market](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-real-estate-multiple-offers-on-most-homes-placed-on-the-market)). A lender can also refer you to agents, but here’s the catch: their recommendations might not be as tailored as a realtor’s. Lenders focus on the money; realtors focus on the mission.

If you do start with a lender, make sure they’re legit. Ask for references, check their track record, and don’t sign anything until you’ve read every word.

## The Santa Clarita Market: Why Timing Matters

The Santa Clarita real estate market is heating up. As of July 2024, inventory hit a two-year high with 505 listings. That’s good news for buyers—more choices mean more leverage. But with mortgage rates creeping closer to the “magic number”, competition is fierce, especially for homes under $750,000.

Starting with a realtor ensures you’re ready to pounce when the right home hits the market. I’ll set you up with real-time alerts through [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings) and guide you through every step, from offer to closing.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Buying a home isn’t all sunshine and open houses. Here are some traps to dodge, and how a realtor helps:

	- **Overpaying for a Home**: Pricing your offer too high—or buying a home that’s priced too high—can haunt you for years. I’ll analyze comps and market trends to keep you grounded. See [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/pricing-your-home-too-high-maybe-the-reason-its-not-selling](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/pricing-your-home-too-high-maybe-the-reason-its-not-selling) for more.

	- **Skipping Inspections**: Don’t let a shiny kitchen blind you to dry rot or faulty wiring. I’ll push for thorough inspections.

	- **Ignoring Title Issues**: A clean title is non-negotiable. I’ll make sure you understand title insurance and preliminary reports.

	- **Signing Blind**: Never sign a contract without reading it. I’ll break down every document, from buyer agreements to purchase contracts.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
