### Santa Clarita Real Estate Update: January 16, 2025

Welcome to today’s detailed update on the Santa Clarita real estate market! The data and insights below are designed to give you a comprehensive view of current market conditions and help you make informed decisions whether you’re buying, selling, or simply staying informed about the Santa Clarita Valley. Let’s dive into the latest trends and analysis.

#### Active Listings in Santa Clarita Valley

As of today, there are **444 active listings** across all Santa Clarita Valley cities. This total includes a mix of condominiums, townhomes, and single-family residences—everything that falls under the residential category. Compared to last week, the market has seen a significant uptick in activity with **59 new listings** posted in the past seven days. Additionally, there are **18 "coming soon" listings** currently in process.

To access these exclusive coming soon properties, you’ll need to have a trusted real estate professional on your side. Your agent can provide detailed insights and access to properties before they officially hit the market. Learn more about finding the perfect agent by visiting [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com).

#### Lending Trends: A Calm Market

The lending market in Santa Clarita remains calm, with interest rates holding steady. This consistency provides a solid foundation for both buyers and sellers to make confident decisions without the added stress of fluctuating rates. If you’re considering purchasing a property, it’s critical to connect with a lender who prioritizes your needs and adheres to the highest standards of integrity.

For recommendations on the best lenders in Santa Clarita, contact me at **661.400.1720** or email me at connor@santaclaritaopenhouses.com. I’ll connect you with a professional who shares my philosophy of putting the client first.

#### Seller Insights: Pricing Strategies That Work

For sellers, understanding current pricing trends is vital. Properties that are priced correctly from the start often generate significant interest, leading to multiple offers. Sellers are receiving **97-100% of their asking prices**, making it a great time to list your property.

When a home is popular, the negotiation process becomes crucial. Sellers might choose to:

	- 
	Respond to a single buyer.

	

	- 
	Negotiate with multiple buyers individually.

	

	- 
	Issue a blanket response to all interested parties.

	

If you’re thinking about selling your home, my **100-point marketing plan** is designed to maximize visibility and attract the right buyers. Explore the plan at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/100.

#### How Insurance Issues Are Impacting the Market

Southern California has seen devastating fires over the past year, and the real estate market is feeling the effects. Many homeowners are facing challenges with insurance claims, as policies are often falling short of covering the full value of their homes. These issues could lead to shifts in the market as regulations evolve to address these gaps.

If you’re a buyer, understanding how these changes could impact your investment is critical. Sellers, too, should be aware of how insurance trends might influence their home’s marketability. For the latest updates and guidance, reach out at **661.400.1720** or visit [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com).

#### Tech Industry Professionals Are Moving to Santa Clarita

Santa Clarita’s appeal continues to grow among tech professionals and day traders, thanks in part to the region’s excellent internet infrastructure. Most neighborhoods offer gigabit download speeds with providers such as Spectrum, AT&amp;T, and Verizon. This makes Santa Clarita an attractive option for those who rely on fast, reliable internet connections for work or trading.

When evaluating properties, it’s a good idea to check the available internet options. You can do this online by entering the property’s address on the provider’s website. For more guidance on selecting a home in a tech-friendly area, contact me directly at **661.400.1720**.

#### Buyer Tips: The Importance of a Good Lender

For buyers, having the right lender can make or break your real estate journey. While there are many lenders to choose from, not all of them prioritize your needs. A great lender will focus on serving and protecting you, ensuring the loan process is smooth and tailored to your financial goals. If you’re unsure where to start, let me refer you to a trusted professional.

Visit [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com) for additional resources or call me at **661.400.1720** for a personal consultation.

#### The Future of Santa Clarita Real Estate

Looking ahead, the Santa Clarita market remains steady. While we’re not seeing dramatic price increases, the demand for well-priced properties continues to drive competition. If inventory levels rise and buyer demand holds strong, we may begin to see modest increases in property values.

### Santa Clarita Home Values: A Closer Look at Local Trends

When it comes to Santa Clarita real estate, understanding home values is key to making informed decisions. From Agua Dulce\u2019s sprawling estates to Canyon Country\u2019s family-friendly neighborhoods, each area has unique characteristics that shape its property values. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the latest data from January 9 to January 16, 2025, providing insights for buyers and sellers alike.

#### **Top Highlights by Area**

	- 
	**Agua Dulce (ADUL):**

	
		**Average List Price:** $1,340,176

		- **Average Price Per Square Foot:** $464.25

		Known for its expansive properties and serene landscapes, Agua Dulce continues to be one of the most desirable areas in Santa Clarita. Buyers looking for privacy and luxury will find plenty to explore here.

	

	
	- 
	**Canyon Country 1 (CAN1):**

	
		**Closed Price vs. List Price:** 100%

		Canyon Country\u2019s consistent market performance makes it an attractive option for families and first-time homebuyers. Sellers in this area are achieving their full asking price, a testament to the high demand.

	

	
	- 
	**Tesoro de Valle (TSRO):**

	
		**Median Close Price:** $1,474,993

		Tesoro de Valle offers a mix of luxury and community-focused amenities. With a median close price nearing $1.5 million, it\u2019s clear this neighborhood remains a top choice for discerning buyers.

	

	
	- 
	**Castaic Junction (CJCT) and Northlake (NLAK):**

	
		**Fewest Properties Listed:** Only 1 each

		These areas currently have limited inventory, presenting opportunities for sellers to capture attention in a less competitive market.

		- **Northlake Average Days on Market (Active Under Contract):** 259 days

		This extended timeframe reflects unique buyer preferences or specific property characteristics in this niche market.

	

	
	- 
	**Val Verde (VVER):**

	
		**Minimum Square Footage Listed:** 714 sq. ft.

		Val Verde offers more compact options for buyers seeking affordability and charm in a quieter corner of Santa Clarita.

	

	

#### **Emerging Market Patterns**

	- 
	**Closed Properties Dominate:** With 183 closed listings, completed transactions are the most common status. This indicates a healthy market cycle, where buyers and sellers are successfully reaching agreements.

	

	- 
	**Coming Soon Listings:** Interestingly, there are no properties listed as "Coming Soon" in the $1,000,000-$1,100,000 price range. This could signal a gap in inventory for this segment, offering an opportunity for potential sellers to fill the void.

	

	- 
	**Days on Market Trends:** Active and "Coming Soon" properties generally spend fewer days on the market compared to "Pending" or "Closed" listings. This is because newer listings tend to generate more immediate interest.

	

#### **Buyer Takeaways**

	- **Agua Dulce and Tesoro de Valle:** These areas cater to luxury buyers and those seeking larger homes. Be prepared to compete for properties priced accurately within these markets.

	- **Canyon Country 1:** A great area for buyers who value stability and predictability in pricing. Act quickly to secure properties, as demand remains high.

	- **Northlake and Castaic Junction:** Limited listings may offer buyers unique opportunities, but be prepared for properties to remain on the market longer.

#### **Seller Strategies**

	- **Highlight Local Strengths:** Sellers in areas like Agua Dulce and Tesoro de Valle can emphasize their homes\u2019 luxury features to attract top-tier buyers.

	- **Price to Perform:** Accurate pricing is critical to securing full asking prices, as demonstrated by the Canyon Country 1 market.

	- **Monitor Market Gaps:** If you\u2019re considering listing in underrepresented price ranges, such as $1,000,000-$1,100,000, you could capture significant buyer interest.

#### **Final Thoughts**

Santa Clarita\u2019s diverse neighborhoods offer opportunities for every type of buyer and seller. Whether you\u2019re aiming for the high-end market in Tesoro de Valle or looking for a hidden gem in Val Verde, understanding the nuances of each area is essential.
