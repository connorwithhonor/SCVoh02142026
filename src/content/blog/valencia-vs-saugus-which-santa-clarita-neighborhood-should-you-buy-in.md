**INTRODUCTION**

"Should I buy in Valencia or Saugus?"

I've heard this question about 10,000 times in my 27 years in Santa Clarita real estate. And the answer is always the same:

**It depends.**

I know, I know—you wanted a simple answer. But here's the reality: Valencia and Saugus are two completely different neighborhoods serving completely different buyers. What's perfect for one family is a nightmare for another.

I'm Connor MacIvor. I've lived and worked in Santa Clarita since 1998, and before that, I spent 20 years with LAPD. I've seen this valley grow from a sleepy bedroom community to one of the most desirable places to live in Southern California. I've helped hundreds of families choose between Valencia and Saugus, and I've seen the right choice change lives—and the wrong choice create years of regret.

So let's break this down honestly. No real estate fluff. No "both neighborhoods are great!" BS. Just straight talk about what each area offers, what it costs, and who it's actually right for.

By the end of this article, you'll know exactly which neighborhood fits your lifestyle, budget, and long-term goals.

Let's go.

**THE QUICK ANSWER (IF YOU'RE IN A HURRY)**

**Buy in Valencia if:**

**Buy in Saugus if:**

**Now let's dig into the details.**

**PRICE COMPARISON: WHAT $800K GETS YOU**

Let's talk money first, because that's what matters.

**VALENCIA:**

$800,000 in Valencia (2026 market) typically gets you:

**SAUGUS:**

$800,000 in Saugus (2026 market) typically gets you:

**BOTTOM LINE:**

In Saugus, you get **more square footage and more land** for the same price. In Valencia, you get **newer construction and community amenities** but less space and higher ongoing costs.

**SCHOOLS: THE DECIDING FACTOR FOR MOST FAMILIES**

Let's be honest: **schools drive real estate prices in Santa Clarita**. And Valencia has the edge here.

**VALENCIA SCHOOLS (Hart District):**

**SAUGUS SCHOOLS (Also Hart District, but different schools):**

**THE REALITY:**

If you're moving to Santa Clarita from LA, **Saugus schools are a massive upgrade**. But if you're comparing within Santa Clarita, Valencia schools have the edge—and parents know it. That's why Valencia home prices are higher.

However, here's what most people don't consider: **your kid's success depends more on your family's involvement than the school's rating**. A motivated student will thrive at Saugus High. A lazy student will coast at Valencia High.

Don't overpay for a school rating if your family situation doesn't support it.

**LIFESTYLE &amp; COMMUNITY FEEL**

This is where Valencia and Saugus diverge dramatically.

**VALENCIA: THE PLANNED COMMUNITY**

Valencia was designed by The Newhall Land and Farming Company as a master-planned community. Everything is intentional:

**Pros:**

**Cons:**

**SAUGUS: THE INDEPENDENT NEIGHBORHOOD**

Saugus predates Valencia's planned-community approach. It's more organic:

**Pros:**

**Cons:**

**BOTTOM LINE:**

Valencia is for people who want convenience, amenities, and a polished community feel.

Saugus is for people who want space, independence, and lower ongoing costs.

Neither is better—they're just different.

**COMMUTE TIMES: WHO WINS?**

Both Valencia and Saugus have good freeway access, but there are differences.

**VALENCIA:**

**SAUGUS:**

**VERDICT:**

Saugus has a slight edge for Antelope Valley commuters (Palmdale, Lancaster, Edwards AFB). Valencia has a slight edge for LA/Burbank commuters. But honestly, the difference is negligible—both are solid for commuting.

**LONG-TERM VALUE: WHICH APPRECIATES BETTER?**

This is where it gets interesting.

**VALENCIA:**

**SAUGUS:**

**HISTORICAL DATA (1998-2026):**

Both Valencia and Saugus have appreciated well over the past 25+ years. Valencia homes have appreciated slightly faster due to school ratings and newer construction, but Saugus homes have also seen strong gains—especially in desirable pockets like North Saugus and areas near Canyon Country.

**MY TAKE:**

If you're buying for 10+ years, both will appreciate. But Valencia's appreciation will be steadier and more predictable. Saugus appreciation will depend more on your specific property and how well you maintain it.

**HIDDEN COSTS: WHAT MOST AGENTS WON'T TELL YOU**

Let's talk about the costs nobody mentions until you're in contract.

**VALENCIA HIDDEN COSTS:**

**Annual hidden costs in Valencia: $4,000-$8,000+**

**SAUGUS HIDDEN COSTS:**

**Annual hidden costs in Saugus: $3,000-$10,000+ (depending on home condition)**

**BOTTOM LINE:**

Valencia costs are predictable and ongoing. Saugus costs are unpredictable and episodic. Choose your pain.

**WHO SHOULD BUY IN VALENCIA?**

You're a Valencia buyer if:

**Typical Valencia buyer profile:**

**WHO SHOULD BUY IN SAUGUS?**

You're a Saugus buyer if:

**Typical Saugus buyer profile:**

**THE NEIGHBORHOODS NOBODY TALKS ABOUT**

Here's the insider knowledge most agents won't share:

**BEST VALENCIA VILLAGES (RANKED):**

**BEST SAUGUS POCKETS (RANKED):**

**FINAL THOUGHTS: HOW TO CHOOSE**

Here's how I'd decide if I were you:

**Step 1: Determine your budget (total cost of ownership, not just mortgage)**

**Step 2: Prioritize your top 3 must-haves**

**Step 3: Visit both areas multiple times**

**Step 4: Work with an agent who knows BOTH areas deeply**

**MY HONEST TAKE**

I don't sell real estate anymore—I run a referral service. So I have zero incentive to push you toward Valencia or Saugus. My only goal is to match you with the right neighborhood and the right agent.

If you came to me and said "I have $800K and I want the best investment," I'd say **Valencia**—newer homes, better schools, more predictable appreciation.

If you came to me and said "I have $800K and I want the most house," I'd say **Saugus**—more space, bigger lot, lower ongoing costs.

But if you came to me and said "I have $800K and I want to be happy," I'd ask you 20 questions about your lifestyle, priorities, and long-term goals before I gave you an answer.

Because the right neighborhood for you isn't the one with the highest ratings or the lowest costs—it's the one that fits YOUR life.

**Want help figuring out which neighborhood is right for you? Reach out. I'll connect you with an agent who knows both areas inside and out and will give you straight answers.**

**No referral fees. No pressure. Just honest guidance.**

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
