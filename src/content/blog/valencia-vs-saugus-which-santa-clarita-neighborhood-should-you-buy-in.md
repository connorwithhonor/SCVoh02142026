**INTRODUCTION**

"Should I buy in Valencia or Saugus?"

I've heard this question about 10,000 times in my 27 years in Santa Clarita real estate. And the answer is always the same:

**It depends.**

I know, I know—you wanted a simple answer. But here's the reality: Valencia and Saugus are two completely different neighborhoods serving completely different buyers. What's perfect for one family is a nightmare for another.

I'm Connor MacIvor. I've lived and worked in Santa Clarita since 1998, and before that, I spent 20 years with LAPD. I've seen this valley grow from a sleepy bedroom community to one of the most desirable places to live in Southern California. I've helped hundreds of families choose between Valencia and Saugus, and I've seen the right choice change lives—and the wrong choice create years of regret.

So let's break this down honestly. No real estate fluff. No "both neighborhoods are great!" BS. Just straight talk about what each area offers, what it costs, and who it's actually right for.

By the end of this article, you'll know exactly which neighborhood fits your lifestyle, budget, and long-term goals.

Let's go.

**THE QUICK ANSWER (IF YOU'RE IN A HURRY)**

**Buy in Valencia if:**

	- You want newer homes with modern features

	- You value amenities (pools, parks, trails, community events)

	- You're willing to pay HOA fees for maintained neighborhoods

	- You prioritize top-rated schools (Hart District)

	- You don't mind Mello-Roos taxes

	- You want a polished, planned-community feel

**Buy in Saugus if:**

	- You want more home for your money

	- You prefer older neighborhoods with established trees and character

	- You don't want HOA fees or Mello-Roos

	- You're okay with older homes that may need updates

	- You value independence over community amenities

	- You're comfortable with schools in the William S. Hart Union High School District (still good, just not Valencia-level)

**Now let's dig into the details.**

**PRICE COMPARISON: WHAT $800K GETS YOU**

Let's talk money first, because that's what matters.

**VALENCIA:**

$800,000 in Valencia (2026 market) typically gets you:

	- **1,800-2,200 sq ft home**

	- Built in 2000-2015

	- 3-4 bedrooms, 2.5-3 bathrooms

	- 2-car garage

	- Small to moderate lot (4,000-6,500 sq ft)

	- HOA fees: $150-$300/month

	- Mello-Roos: $2,000-$4,000/year

	- Modern finishes, newer HVAC, updated kitchen

	- Community amenities (pools, parks, trails)

**SAUGUS:**

$800,000 in Saugus (2026 market) typically gets you:

	- **2,200-2,800 sq ft home**

	- Built in 1970s-1990s

	- 4-5 bedrooms, 2.5-3 bathrooms

	- 2-3 car garage

	- Larger lot (7,000-10,000+ sq ft)

	- No HOA fees

	- No Mello-Roos

	- Older finishes (may need kitchen/bath updates)

	- Mature landscaping, established trees

	- No community amenities (you're on your own for pools, etc.)

**BOTTOM LINE:**

In Saugus, you get **more square footage and more land** for the same price. In Valencia, you get **newer construction and community amenities** but less space and higher ongoing costs.

**SCHOOLS: THE DECIDING FACTOR FOR MOST FAMILIES**

Let's be honest: **schools drive real estate prices in Santa Clarita**. And Valencia has the edge here.

**VALENCIA SCHOOLS (Hart District):**

	- Consistently ranked among the top districts in California

	- GreatSchools ratings: 8-10/10 for most elementary and middle schools

	- High schools: West Ranch (9/10), Valencia High (8/10), Golden Valley (8/10)

	- Strong AP programs, excellent sports, active parent involvement

	- Newer facilities, better funding, more resources

**SAUGUS SCHOOLS (Also Hart District, but different schools):**

	- Still good schools—let's be clear about that

	- GreatSchools ratings: 6-9/10 for most elementary and middle schools

	- High schools: Saugus High (7/10), Canyon High (7/10)

	- Solid academics, decent sports programs

	- Older facilities, slightly less funding than newer Valencia schools

	- Still FAR better than most LA County schools

**THE REALITY:**

If you're moving to Santa Clarita from LA, **Saugus schools are a massive upgrade**. But if you're comparing within Santa Clarita, Valencia schools have the edge—and parents know it. That's why Valencia home prices are higher.

However, here's what most people don't consider: **your kid's success depends more on your family's involvement than the school's rating**. A motivated student will thrive at Saugus High. A lazy student will coast at Valencia High.

Don't overpay for a school rating if your family situation doesn't support it.

**LIFESTYLE &amp; COMMUNITY FEEL**

This is where Valencia and Saugus diverge dramatically.

**VALENCIA: THE PLANNED COMMUNITY**

Valencia was designed by The Newhall Land and Farming Company as a master-planned community. Everything is intentional:

	- Wide, tree-lined streets

	- Neighborhood parks every few blocks

	- Community pools, clubhouses, trails

	- HOA-maintained landscaping (your front yard looks good even if you're lazy)

	- Regular community events (movie nights, holiday celebrations, etc.)

	- Shopping and dining within walking/biking distance in most villages

	- Consistent architectural styles (everything looks clean and cohesive)

**Pros:**

	- Low-maintenance lifestyle (HOA handles a lot)

	- Safe, family-friendly, "Mayberry" vibe

	- Easy to meet neighbors through community events

	- Kids can bike to parks, pools, and friends' houses safely

**Cons:**

	- HOA rules can be restrictive (no RVs in driveway, limited paint colors, etc.)

	- Can feel "sterile" or "cookie-cutter" to some people

	- Less individuality in home design and landscaping

	- You're paying for amenities whether you use them or not

**SAUGUS: THE INDEPENDENT NEIGHBORHOOD**

Saugus predates Valencia's planned-community approach. It's more organic:

	- Older homes with varied architectural styles

	- Mature trees, established landscaping

	- Larger lots with more privacy

	- No HOAs (in most areas), so you control your property

	- Quieter, more "leave me alone" vibe

	- Less foot traffic, fewer community events

	- More DIY homeownership (you maintain everything)

**Pros:**

	- More freedom (paint your house purple if you want)

	- Larger lots, more privacy

	- Established neighborhoods with character

	- No HOA fees or restrictions

	- Better for people who value independence

**Cons:**

	- You're responsible for ALL maintenance (front yard, landscaping, etc.)

	- Fewer amenities (no community pools or parks nearby in most areas)

	- Older homes = more repairs and updates needed

	- Less "community feel" if that's important to you

**BOTTOM LINE:**

Valencia is for people who want convenience, amenities, and a polished community feel.

Saugus is for people who want space, independence, and lower ongoing costs.

Neither is better—they're just different.

**COMMUTE TIMES: WHO WINS?**

Both Valencia and Saugus have good freeway access, but there are differences.

**VALENCIA:**

	- Close to I-5 (Magic Mountain Parkway, Valencia Blvd exits)

	- Commute to LA (Downtown): 45-70 minutes depending on traffic

	- Commute to Burbank: 30-50 minutes

	- Commute to Palmdale/Lancaster: 25-35 minutes

	- Close to Metrolink station (Valencia Town Center)

**SAUGUS:**

	- Close to Highway 14 and I-5 interchange

	- Commute to LA (Downtown): 50-75 minutes depending on traffic

	- Commute to Burbank: 35-55 minutes

	- Commute to Palmdale/Lancaster: 20-30 minutes

	- Slightly farther from Metrolink

**VERDICT:**

Saugus has a slight edge for Antelope Valley commuters (Palmdale, Lancaster, Edwards AFB). Valencia has a slight edge for LA/Burbank commuters. But honestly, the difference is negligible—both are solid for commuting.

**LONG-TERM VALUE: WHICH APPRECIATES BETTER?**

This is where it gets interesting.

**VALENCIA:**

	- Newer homes = less immediate maintenance

	- Master-planned communities tend to hold value well

	- Desirable schools = consistent buyer demand

	- HOA maintenance keeps neighborhoods looking good

	- BUT: Mello-Roos doesn't go away, which can limit buyer pool

**SAUGUS:**

	- Older homes = potential for value-add renovations

	- Larger lots = more appeal as land becomes scarce

	- No Mello-Roos = broader buyer appeal

	- BUT: Older homes can look dated without updates

**HISTORICAL DATA (1998-2026):**

Both Valencia and Saugus have appreciated well over the past 25+ years. Valencia homes have appreciated slightly faster due to school ratings and newer construction, but Saugus homes have also seen strong gains—especially in desirable pockets like North Saugus and areas near Canyon Country.

**MY TAKE:**

If you're buying for 10+ years, both will appreciate. But Valencia's appreciation will be steadier and more predictable. Saugus appreciation will depend more on your specific property and how well you maintain it.

**HIDDEN COSTS: WHAT MOST AGENTS WON'T TELL YOU**

Let's talk about the costs nobody mentions until you're in contract.

**VALENCIA HIDDEN COSTS:**

	- **Mello-Roos taxes:** $2,000-$4,000/year on top of property taxes

	- **HOA fees:** $150-$300/month ($1,800-$3,600/year)

	- **Special assessments:** Occasional one-time fees for major HOA repairs ($1,000-$10,000)

	- **Landscaping:** If your HOA doesn't cover backyard, you're still paying for front yard maintenance through HOA dues

**Annual hidden costs in Valencia: $4,000-$8,000+**

**SAUGUS HIDDEN COSTS:**

	- **Deferred maintenance:** Older homes = more repairs (HVAC, roof, plumbing, electrical)

	- **Landscaping:** You're responsible for all of it (front and back)

	- **Pest control:** Older homes = more issues with termites, rodents, etc.

	- **Energy inefficiency:** Older windows, insulation, HVAC = higher utility bills

**Annual hidden costs in Saugus: $3,000-$10,000+ (depending on home condition)**

**BOTTOM LINE:**

Valencia costs are predictable and ongoing. Saugus costs are unpredictable and episodic. Choose your pain.

**WHO SHOULD BUY IN VALENCIA?**

You're a Valencia buyer if:

	- **You're a young family** prioritizing top schools and safe neighborhoods

	- **You value convenience** over space (closer to shopping, dining, amenities)

	- **You don't mind HOAs** and actually appreciate the maintained community feel

	- **You're willing to pay more** for newer construction and less immediate maintenance

	- **You want a turnkey lifestyle** where you're not constantly fixing things

	- **You're okay with smaller lots** in exchange for community pools and parks

**Typical Valencia buyer profile:**

	- Dual-income household

	- Kids in elementary or middle school

	- Coming from LA or Orange County

	- Values "move-in ready" over "fixer-upper"

	- Willing to pay HOA fees for maintained neighborhoods

**WHO SHOULD BUY IN SAUGUS?**

You're a Saugus buyer if:

	- **You want more home for your money** (bigger house, bigger lot)

	- **You value independence** and don't want HOA restrictions

	- **You're handy** or willing to hire contractors for updates

	- **You prefer established neighborhoods** with mature trees and character

	- **You don't need brand-new everything**—you're okay with cosmetic updates

	- **You want lower ongoing costs** (no HOA, no Mello-Roos)

**Typical Saugus buyer profile:**

	- Single-income or retiring household

	- Kids in high school or out of the house

	- Coming from higher-cost areas and downsizing expenses

	- Values privacy and space over community amenities

	- Comfortable with DIY projects or renovation budgets

**THE NEIGHBORHOODS NOBODY TALKS ABOUT**

Here's the insider knowledge most agents won't share:

**BEST VALENCIA VILLAGES (RANKED):**

	- **Westridge** - Premium, highly sought-after, excellent schools, higher prices

	- **Bridgeport** - Newer homes, great amenities, strong resale value

	- **Northpark** - Family-friendly, well-maintained, good schools

	- **Valencia Woodlands** - Established, tree-lined streets, strong community

	- **West Creek** - Luxury end of Valencia, golf course access, higher price point

**BEST SAUGUS POCKETS (RANKED):**

	- **North Saugus (Via Princessa area)** - Larger lots, hillside views, quiet

	- **Old Orchard areas** - Established, mature trees, close to shopping

	- **Bouquet Canyon corridor** - Larger properties, more rural feel

	- **East Saugus (near Golden Valley)** - Access to good schools, more affordable

	- **West Saugus (near I-5)** - Convenient freeway access, mixed housing stock

**FINAL THOUGHTS: HOW TO CHOOSE**

Here's how I'd decide if I were you:

**Step 1: Determine your budget (total cost of ownership, not just mortgage)**

	- Can you afford $5,000/month in Valencia (mortgage + HOA + Mello-Roos)?

	- Or do you need to keep total housing costs under $4,000/month?

**Step 2: Prioritize your top 3 must-haves**

	- Schools? → Valencia

	- Space? → Saugus

	- Low maintenance? → Valencia

	- Low ongoing costs? → Saugus

	- Community feel? → Valencia

	- Independence? → Saugus

**Step 3: Visit both areas multiple times**

	- Drive through neighborhoods in morning, afternoon, evening

	- Check out local parks, schools, shopping

	- Talk to residents (people love sharing opinions)

**Step 4: Work with an agent who knows BOTH areas deeply**

	- Not someone who just pulls MLS listings

	- Someone who's lived here, worked here, raised kids here

	- Someone who'll tell you the truth about each neighborhood's pros and cons

**MY HONEST TAKE**

I don't sell real estate anymore—I run a referral service. So I have zero incentive to push you toward Valencia or Saugus. My only goal is to match you with the right neighborhood and the right agent.

If you came to me and said "I have $800K and I want the best investment," I'd say **Valencia**—newer homes, better schools, more predictable appreciation.

If you came to me and said "I have $800K and I want the most house," I'd say **Saugus**—more space, bigger lot, lower ongoing costs.

But if you came to me and said "I have $800K and I want to be happy," I'd ask you 20 questions about your lifestyle, priorities, and long-term goals before I gave you an answer.

Because the right neighborhood for you isn't the one with the highest ratings or the lowest costs—it's the one that fits YOUR life.

**Want help figuring out which neighborhood is right for you? Reach out. I'll connect you with an agent who knows both areas inside and out and will give you straight answers.**

**No referral fees. No pressure. Just honest guidance.**
