TL;DR: As of September 29, 2025, the Santa Clarita Valley real estate scene is buzzing with 1125 residential listings across key areas like Canyon Country, Castaic, Newhall, Saugus, Stevenson Ranch, and Valencia. Active listings dominate at 725, with average list prices around $899,320 and homes sitting 67 days on market – a sign of steady but not scorching demand. Coming Soon teases 10 fresh entries, Pending holds 190 deals in limbo, and last week's 45 closings averaged $844,662 sold price (99.2% of list). Buyers, snag deals in lower brackets where $/sqft dips to bargains; sellers, price sharp or risk the Expired pile (10 this week).

## Hey Santa Clarita, Let's Cut the BS on Today's Housing Hustle

Look, I've been in the trenches – from dodging bullets as an LAPD motor cop to slinging homes as a Realtor (CALDRE 01238257) for years. I've seen markets flip faster than a bad real estate flipper's profit margin. Today, September 29, 2025, we're staring down a Santa Clarita Valley market that's got more listings than excuses from a flaky buyer. 1125 residential properties in play? That's not just numbers; that's opportunity wrapped in caution tape for buyers and sellers alike.

As someone who's walked the walk – shedding 135 pounds at 52 through sheer grit and smart strategies, much like navigating this market – I'm here to break it down without the corporate spin. No fluffy agent-speak; just straight Gen X truth with a side of sarcasm. If you're buying, selling, or just rubbernecking, these stats from the latest MLS pull (covering everything from Coming Soon to Withdrawn) will arm you better than my old service weapon. And hey, if AI's your jam for outsmarting the competition, we'll touch on that too – because why grind when tech can grind for you?

Let's dive in, starting with the big picture. Want the full list of homes matching your dream? Hit up [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/dream-home-finder](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/dream-home-finder) for a custom search that won't ghost you.

## The Overall Market Pulse: 1125 Listings – Boom or Bust?

First off, the grand total: 1125 residential listings across our valley hotspots. That's a hefty inventory, folks – enough to make Zillow jealous. The average list price sits at $895,432, with homes averaging 65 days on market. Close prices? Around $844,662, clocking in at 99.2% of list price on average. That SP/LP ratio screams "negotiable but not desperate" – buyers can chisel a bit, but sellers aren't folding like cheap lawn chairs.

Break it down: Min list price $135,000 (a steal for a fixer-upper vibe), max $5,500,000 (for those dreaming of mansion life without the Malibu traffic). Average size? 2,146 sqft, built around 1996, with 3 beds/3 baths and $/sqft at $434.21. Lot sizes vary wildly from tiny urban pads to sprawling estates up to 1,526,865,120 sqft (yeah, that's a beast – probably a ranch or development play).

For buyers: This market's got variety. Low-end bargains under $300k average 1,064 sqft at $331/sqft – perfect for first-timers or investors sniffing flips. High-end? Over $2M pushes into luxury territory with bigger lots and newer builds. Sellers: With 725 actives, competition's fierce. Price too high, and you'll join the 10 expired or 14 canceled this week. Pro tip: Get a free market analysis at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/free-market-analysis](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/free-market-analysis) to avoid that fate.

Sarcasm alert: If you're still relying on Zillow for "Zestimates," good luck – that's like using a flip phone in the AI age. Real data like this is your edge.

## Coming Soon: The Tease That's Got Everyone Buzzing (10 Listings)

Ah, the "Coming Soon" category – real estate's version of a movie trailer. As of today, 10 properties are poised to hit the market, averaging $1,507,290 list price. These aren't on the active radar yet, but they're whispering "get ready" to savvy buyers.

Price breakdown: Starts low at $415,000 (a cozy 810 sqft, 2/1 built 1990, $512/sqft) in the $400k-500k bucket, jumping to luxury like $3,750,000 (6/11 baths, 7,500 sqft monster from 2005 at $500/sqft). Average? 3,224 sqft, 4 beds/4 baths, built 1997, $464/sqft. No days on market yet – they're fresh.

Buyers: This is your early bird special. Jump on previews via [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings) to beat the rush. With only 10, it's slim pickings, but they span from affordable starters to high-end havens. Sellers: If your home's in this phase, hype it right – bad photos or overpricing, and it'll flop harder than my pre-fasting diet attempts.

Humor time: Coming Soon listings are like that friend who says they're "almost ready" – exciting, but don't hold your breath too long.

## Active Listings: The Main Event – 725 Homes Waiting for Their Match

Here's where the rubber meets the road: 725 active listings, the heartbeat of the market. Average list $899,320, 67 days on market, 2,166 sqft, $432/sqft, 3/3 beds/baths, built 1998. Min $250,000 (tiny 482 sqft condo vibe), max $5,500,000 (1,413 sqft at a whopping $3,892/sqft – must be prime location or ultra-lux).

Let's slice by price ranges – because not everyone's balling like Elon.

Buyers: Inventory's your friend – 725 options mean negotiation power, especially in higher days-on-market brackets like $1.2M+ (93 days avg). Use AI tools to scan for hidden gems; at HonorElevate.com, we automate searches to flag price drops. Sellers: Average 67 days? That's time to tweak. If your home's lingering, reconsider pricing – check my sold listings at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/my-sold-listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/my-sold-listings) for real comps.

Gen X vibe: Remember when houses sold themselves? Yeah, me neither in this market. It's like dating in the 90s – lots of options, but you gotta stand out.

## Active Under Contract: The Almost-Dones (117 Listings)

117 homes in limbo – average $885,264 list, 73 days on market, 2,066 sqft, $439/sqft, 3/3, 1992 build.

Ranges: From $299,500 (1/1, 675 sqft) to $3,950,000 (6/9, 6,792 sqft). Most in $700k-800k (20 listings, avg $764/sqft wait no, $763,974 list, 86 days).

Buyers: These could fall through – backups welcome. Sellers: Congrats on the contract, but don't count chickens till escrow closes. Common pitfalls? Inspections – read up at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/importance-of-inspection](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/importance-of-inspection).

Sarcasm: Under contract is like "in a relationship" on Facebook – it's complicated till the ring (or keys) is on.

## Pending: Deals in the Pipeline (190 Listings)

190 pending, avg $871,364 list, 56 days, 2,108 sqft, $434/sqft, 3/3, 1992.

From $135k low-end to $4.2M high. Closed soon-ish.

Buyers: Market's moving – act fast on actives. Sellers: High pending means demand; if priced right, you're next.

Link to foreclosures if relevant: [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/foreclosure-search](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/foreclosure-search), though low in this data.

## Closed Last Week: What Actually Sold (45 Homes)

The real tea: 45 closings in the past 7 days (09/22 to 09/29/2025). Avg list $853,251, sold $844,662 (99.2% SP/LP), 47 days, 1,964 sqft, $465/sqft, 3/3, 1989 build.

Breakdown:

Buyers: See what's closing – over list in some (like $700k+ at 100.3%), under in others (high-end 93.9%). Trends show quick sales under $700k.

Sellers: 99.2% avg means good returns if prepped. Avoid overpricing; see my glossary for terms like SP/LP at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/real-estate-glossary](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/real-estate-glossary).

Humor: Closing 45 homes? That's like my fasting wins – consistent effort pays off, but one bad inspection and it's back to square one.

## The Dark Side: Expired, Canceled, Hold, Withdrawn (38 Total)

Not all stories end happy. 10 expired (avg $696k, 139 days – ouch), 14 canceled ($727k, 98 days), 9 hold ($1.16M, 45 days), 5 withdrawn ($1.03M, 118 days).

Why? Overpriced, poor marketing, life changes. Sellers, learn from this – right pricing is key. Buyers, these could relist cheaper.
