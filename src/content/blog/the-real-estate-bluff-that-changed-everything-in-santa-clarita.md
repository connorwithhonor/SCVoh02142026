## **Part One: The Myth Everyone Believes**

If you’ve been around real estate long enough, you’ve heard the two great myths of our business:

Those two ideas have been repeated so often that most people — even agents — treat them like law. They’re not. They’re myths born from inexperience, fear, and laziness.

This story is about one Santa Clarita listing that shattered both beliefs in one weekend.
It’s a case study in persistence, psychology, and professionalism — and how knowing when to push back can turn a “no” into a full-price “yes.”

Because in real estate, like poker, the one who understands the bluff usually wins.

## **Part Two: Setting the Scene in Santa Clarita**

The home was tucked into one of those picture-perfect Santa Clarita neighborhoods — clean streets, pride of ownership everywhere, and a mix of long-time residents who wave at you as you drive by.

We’d done everything right:

Everything was dialed in. Yet after the first week, traffic was decent but no offers.

I told the seller what I always tell my clients: *we don’t panic; we adapt.* So we planned a second open house for the following weekend.

That decision changed everything.

## **Part Three: The Neighbor and the Phone Call**

Halfway through the open house, a neighbor strolled in. I could tell by the way he looked around — slow, curious, half-smiling — that he wasn’t buying. But neighbors are gold in real estate.

He said, “Hey, I’ve got a friend who’s been looking for a house in this neighborhood. She’d love this place.”

I smiled. “Perfect. Have her call me.”

The next day, he showed up again — this time with his phone out. “She’s on the line right now,” he said.

I introduced myself over the phone. She was polite, sharp, and motivated. The kind of buyer who knows what she wants but isn’t desperate. She told me she already had an agent. I told her to have that agent reach out.

And just like that, a neighbor referral — born out of an open house — sparked a real transaction.

So much for myth number one.

## **Part Four: The Offer — and the “Best and Final” Bluff**

Her agent reached out the next day. The showing went great. She loved the house. Within 24 hours, we had an offer.

It wasn’t perfect, but it was close. After some back-and-forth, her agent sent over a counter labeled:
**“Buyer’s Best and Final Offer.”**

That phrase is supposed to end everything.
Most sellers freeze right there. Most agents fold.

But I didn’t.

See, before real estate, I spent over two decades as an LAPD officer. Negotiation, psychology, and reading tone — that was my daily toolkit. “Best and final” to me didn’t sound final. It sounded like leverage.

So I looked at my seller and said, “Do you want to play by their rules, or do you want to get what your home is worth?”

They smiled. “Let’s go one more round.”

## **Part Five: Countering the “Final”**

We countered. Respectfully, strategically, and slightly above their number.

Some agents would call that reckless. I call it leadership.

Because here’s what you learn in both law enforcement and real estate: **there’s no harm in asking.** The worst thing they can do is say no.

Within a day, we had a signed acceptance.
The bluff had backfired.

That’s the difference between *selling* and *closing.*

## **Part Six: Lessons in Negotiation Psychology**

Let’s break that moment down because this is where deals are made or lost.

When someone says “best and final,” it’s often a **tactical anchor.** It’s meant to project power, to make you doubt your leverage. But if the buyer truly wanted to walk, they wouldn’t have included that phrase at all — they’d have just disappeared.

That’s your clue.

In negotiation, absolute language is usually emotional, not logical.
The calm professional recognizes it, respects it, and tests it.

That’s not manipulation — it’s clarity.

## **Part Seven: “As-Is” Doesn’t Mean “Hands-Off”**

Once we were in escrow, the next myth surfaced. The property had been sold *as-is*, but that didn’t stop the request for repairs.

This is where experience pays dividends.

In California, lenders require certain health and safety items to be fixed before funding a loan. Faulty wiring, broken smoke detectors, missing GFCIs — these aren’t negotiable.

So when agents proudly announce, “My seller won’t do any repairs,” they’re usually bluffing too.

In this case, the buyer’s requests were legitimate and reasonable. My seller handled them. The deal moved forward. Everyone won.

Another “rule” broken — and another proof that flexibility beats pride.

## **Part Eight: The Open House Myth Dies Again**

Let’s come back to that first myth — *open houses don’t sell homes.*

Here’s the truth: most open houses fail because they’re **poorly executed.**

Agents throw up a few signs, sit on the couch scrolling their phones, and call it marketing. That’s not an open house; that’s a missed opportunity.

A proper open house is a live marketing event. It’s about energy, presentation, conversation, and community. You’re not just selling a home; you’re selling belonging.

That neighbor didn’t walk in because of luck. He walked in because he saw a professional setup — clean signage, good music, inviting staging, and a handshake that said, *you’re welcome here.*

That’s the difference between “just showing up” and *showing up like a pro.*

## **Part Nine: Business Over Emotion**

Most deals fall apart because people get emotional.
Buyers fall in love too quickly.
Sellers take offers personally.
Agents react instead of respond.

But real estate is a business transaction — not a therapy session.

When you detach emotion, you gain clarity. When you focus on numbers, timelines, and strategy, you create outcomes.

My seller could’ve said, “They said final, so I guess it’s over.”
Instead, we countered once more — calmly, respectfully, logically.

That’s not stubbornness. That’s professionalism.

## **Part Ten: The Mindset of a Closer**

I tell every seller this: *You don’t need a pushy agent; you need a persistent one.*

Persistence isn’t about being loud; it’s about being thorough.
It’s understanding every lever in the deal — timing, psychology, market pressure, presentation, and communication.

You can’t fake that. You have to earn it through years of real transactions, both good and bad.

The deal we closed from that open house wasn’t luck. It was pattern recognition.

## **Part Eleven: The Broader Implications**

This one transaction is a microcosm of the Santa Clarita market itself.

Inventory is low. Buyers are serious but cautious. Sellers are optimistic but hesitant. Everyone’s trying to feel the room.

That’s why agents who understand *human behavior* are dominating — not the ones who rely solely on scripts or systems.

AI can analyze data.
Technology can track leads.
But only a human with experience can read tone, pause, and say, “We’re not done yet.”

## **Part Twelve: Lessons for Buyers and Sellers**

### **For Sellers:**

### **For Buyers:**

### **For Agents:**

## **Part Thirteen: TL;DR**

A Santa Clarita neighbor wandered into an open house.
He connected me with a friend who was looking for a home.
She made an offer.
Her agent said “best and final.”
We countered anyway.
They accepted.
We closed escrow.

Moral of the story?
Never assume the rules are real. Test them. With Honor.

## **Part Fourteen: Connect Locally**

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
