**Date:** November 15, 2024 | **Day of Year:** 320 | **Week of Year:** 46

**Introduction to Canyon Country Real Estate:**

Welcome to the Canyon Country real estate market update, where we dive deep into current trends and offer insights for buyers and sellers in Santa Clarita Valley. Each Friday, we focus on Canyon Country’s listings, market statistics, and strategic tips for navigating this area’s dynamic real estate landscape. With over 128 active and coming-soon residential listings, ranging from single-family homes to condos and townhomes, Canyon Country has options catering to various budgets and preferences.

For anyone interested in a comprehensive guide to buying or selling in this region, check out my latest book, *Santa Clarita Real Estate Guide for Buyers and Sellers, 2025 Edition,* available on Kindle at santaclaritaopenhouses.com/book. It covers essential questions to ask, strategies to consider, and insights to help you make informed decisions.

		**Single-Family Homes:** $700,000 to $2.75 million.

	- **Closed Sales in the Last 60 Days:** Approximately 45 properties sold, reflecting a steady but moderate level of market activity as we approach year-end.

	- **Median Sale Price:** Around $740,000, demonstrating sustained demand in Canyon Country.

	- **Average Days on Market:** 44 days on average, with condos generally selling faster due to their accessible price points.

	- **Price Per Square Foot:** Median price per square foot is about $440, varying with location, property age, and amenities.

These price points indicate the flexibility Canyon Country offers for varying buyer needs—from smaller, entry-level properties to larger, more luxurious homes.

**Seller Insights: Maximizing Your Property’s Market Appeal**

If you’re selling in Canyon Country, these strategies can help boost your property’s visibility and attractiveness:

	- 
	**Leverage the 30-Day Price Adjustment Strategy:** If your home has been on the market for over 30 days without much activity, consider a small price reduction. This adjustment can re-engage buyer interest by generating new alerts, which brings your listing back in front of potential buyers who may have initially overlooked it. The refreshed visibility often results in renewed inquiries and viewings.

	

	- 
	**Enhance Online Presence with Virtual Tours and High-Quality Photos:** In today’s digital-first market, quality visuals are essential. Virtual tours, high-quality images, and even short videos can make your listing stand out. Digital marketing investment, including targeted ads on real estate platforms, can provide a boost in exposure, ensuring your property reaches the right audience.

	

	- 
	**Competitive Pricing for Maximum Interest:** For some sellers, pricing slightly below market value can create a sense of urgency among buyers, encouraging multiple offers. This strategy can be especially effective in high-demand neighborhoods within Canyon Country, allowing you to potentially sell faster and with favorable terms.

	

**Buyer Insights: Strategies for Standing Out in Competitive Situations**

For buyers in Canyon Country, here’s how to strengthen your offer and improve your chances of securing a property:

	- 
	**Prepare a Complete Offer Package:** Go beyond a pre-approval by ensuring all financial documentation is ready, including proof of funds and a comprehensive financing outline. Sellers appreciate thoroughness, and a complete offer package can position you as a serious buyer.

	

	- 
	**Offer Flexible Terms When Possible:** Accommodating the seller’s preferred closing timeline or offering a rent-back period can make your offer more appealing, especially if the seller is in transition. This flexibility is often valued as much as a higher price offer and can make a difference in multiple-offer situations.

	

	- 
	**Limit Non-Essential Contingencies:** Consider reducing or waiving non-essential contingencies if feasible, but proceed carefully. A cleaner offer with fewer contingencies can be more attractive to sellers, especially when other offers are on the table. However, always protect your rights to essential inspections and due diligence.

	

**Navigating the Canyon Country Market: Key Considerations**

In addition to the insights provided, it’s important for buyers and sellers to remain well-informed on key market factors:

	- 
	**Local Demand for Canyon Country Real Estate:** With a moderate to high demand for Canyon Country properties, pricing strategy and market timing are essential for sellers. The market’s steady activity suggests that well-prepared, competitively priced homes have a good chance of attracting interest, even as the year closes out.

	

	- 
	**Types of Properties Most in Demand:** Single-family homes continue to lead in demand, particularly those with three to four bedrooms. However, condos and townhomes are moving quickly due to their lower price points, especially attractive to first-time buyers and investors.

	

	- 
	**Seasonal Market Shifts:** With year-end approaching, both buyers and sellers may see changes in market dynamics. For sellers, this can mean slightly longer days on market as holiday distractions set in. For buyers, the end of the year may bring opportunities to negotiate favorable terms as sellers look to close before the new year.
