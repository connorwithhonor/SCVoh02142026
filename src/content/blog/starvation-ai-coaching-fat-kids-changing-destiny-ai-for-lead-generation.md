    Intermittent Fasting Is Better Known as Starvation | Connor With Honor

    

    
        As Americans, we have been conditioned to believe that eating small, frequent meals is the best way to maintain energy levels and stay healthy. But what if constantly eating is keeping you in fat-storage mode?

        Before I lost 135 pounds of fat, I tried everything—low-carb, high-carb, keto, paleo, and more. The one thing that actually worked? Fasting.

        ## Fasting Is Not Starvation

        The biggest myth about intermittent fasting is that it is just a form of starvation. Let’s break that down:

        
            - Starvation is involuntary—your body runs out of nutrients, leading to muscle breakdown and metabolic damage.

            - Intermittent fasting is intentional. Your body burns stored fat for energy while preserving muscle and optimizing hormones.

            - It trains your body to become metabolically flexible, using fat for fuel instead of relying on constant glucose intake.

        

        ## The Benefits of Intermittent Fasting

        When you stop eating for extended periods, your body undergoes significant changes:

        
            - Fat Burning Mode: Your body starts using stored fat instead of relying on frequent food intake.

            - Mental Clarity: Many people report better focus and cognitive function.

            - Muscle Retention: Contrary to popular belief, fasting can help preserve muscle mass when combined with proper nutrition.

            - Weight Loss Without Starvation: Fewer meals but more nutrient-dense food help with sustainable fat loss.

        

        ## My 135-Pound Fat Loss Journey

        I used to be over 50 percent body fat, tipping the scales at 365 pounds. Through fasting, proper refeeding, and strength training, I completely transformed my health. Now, I am stronger, leaner, and performing better than ever.

        ## Watch My Video on Fasting vs. Starvation

        Still think fasting is just another word for starvation? Watch my latest video where I explain the truth behind intermittent fasting:

        
        

        ## How to Get Started with Intermittent Fasting

        If you are unsure where to start, follow these simple steps:

        
            - Skip breakfast and push your first meal back by a few hours.

            - Drink water, black coffee, or tea during your fasting window.

            - Eat high-protein, nutrient-dense meals when breaking your fast.

            - Incorporate strength training to preserve muscle while burning fat.

            - Track progress and adjust your fasting window as needed.

        

        ## Is Fasting Right for You?

        If you are tired of the dieting rollercoaster, intermittent fasting might be the solution. Instead of focusing on what to eat all day, fasting allows your body to do what it was designed to do—burn fat for fuel.

    Can AI Help You Lose Fat? The Truth About AI and Fat Loss
    - 

    

    
        Artificial Intelligence is transforming the world in ways we never imagined. It is already reshaping industries like finance, healthcare, real estate, and cybersecurity—but what about fitness and fat loss? Can AI actually help you burn fat and reach your fitness goals faster? The answer is yes, but only if you use the right AI tools.

        A recent study on large language models (LLMs) suggests AI can be an effective fat-loss coach, but here is the catch: AI is only as good as the data it is trained on. If an AI model is based on outdated, debunked nutrition myths, it can actually steer you in the wrong direction.

        ## The Problem with AI and Outdated Fat Loss Advice

        Many AI-driven fitness platforms are still stuck in old-school calorie restriction theories, telling people to simply eat less and move more—a flawed strategy that ignores metabolism, hormonal balance, and fasting science.

        Here is the reality:

        
            Myth: "Calories in, calories out" is the key to fat loss.

            - Truth: Hormones, insulin sensitivity, and fasting play a bigger role than just calorie counting.

            - Myth: "You need carbs for energy."

            - Truth: Your body produces all the glucose it needs through gluconeogenesis.

        

        ## How AI Can Actually Help You Burn Fat Faster

        Instead of blindly following AI-generated diet plans, use AI as a research tool to refine your fat-loss strategy. The right AI models can:

        
            - Help you structure a fasting plan (intermittent fasting, OMAD, extended fasting).

            - Identify foods that support ketosis and fat burning.

            - Track macros and personalize nutrition based on your goals.

            - Offer AI-generated workout plans tailored to muscle retention and fat loss.

        

        ## Watch My Latest Video on AI and Fat Loss

        If you are serious about using AI to optimize your fat-loss journey, check out my latest video where I break down exactly how AI can help and where it fails.

        

        ## Final Thoughts: AI Can Be a Game-Changer, But Be Smart

        AI is a powerful tool, but it is not perfect. If an AI model tells you to starve yourself on 1,000 calories per day, that is a red flag. Always fact-check, experiment, and trust your own results over outdated theories.

        The right AI can help you lose fat faster, but only if you know how to use it. Be smart, do your research, and leverage AI wisely.

    Fat Kids Have a Hard Road Ahead—Unless You Love Them Enough to Begin Again

    # Fat Kids Have a Hard Road Ahead—Unless You Love Them Enough to Begin Again

    
    Childhood obesity is more common than ever, and it is setting up millions of kids for a lifetime of struggles. If you are a parent, guardian, or anyone responsible for feeding a child, now is the time to make a change. Their future depends on it.

    ## The Harsh Reality of Childhood Obesity

    
    I was a fat kid. My mom made my clothes, always with horizontal stripes. That made me an even bigger target for bullies. If your child is overweight, there is a good chance they are experiencing similar struggles.

    Kids may not always tell you they are being teased, but inside, they are feeling it. Obesity in children leads to social struggles, lower self-esteem, and serious health risks like diabetes, heart disease, and joint issues at an early age. It is time to break the cycle.

    ## Why Are Kids Overweight Today?

    
    Obesity is not genetic—it is a lifestyle issue. The food system has changed, and so have our habits.

    
        - Ultra-processed, sugar-filled junk is now a daily staple.

        - Kids spend more time indoors, glued to screens, rather than running around outside.

        - Food has become a comfort and a reward rather than fuel for the body.

    

    Back in the day, we ate real food—meat, fish, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. No processed junk, no artificial chemicals. The only way forward is to return to these fundamentals.

    ## How to Help Your Child Lose Weight and Build a Healthy Future

    Change starts at home. If your child came to you and said, "Mom, Dad… kids made fun of me today. Is there something I can do not to be fat anymore?"—what would you say?

    Comforting them is natural, but real love means helping them take action.

    ### Steps to a Healthier Life for Your Child:

    
        - **Cut the Sugar:** Eliminate sodas, juices, and processed snacks.

        - **Prioritize Real Food:** Focus on lean proteins, vegetables, fruits, and healthy fats.

        - **Say No to Processed Junk:** If it comes in a bag or a box, it is probably not good.

        - **Encourage Movement:** Get them active—sports, biking, walking, or even simple playtime outside.

        - **Lead by Example:** If you eat healthy, they will too.

    

    ## The Bottom Line: Love Your Kids Enough to Start Again

    Parents have all the power here. The food choices you make for your kids today will define their future. If you truly love them, you will help them build better habits, cut out the junk, and reclaim their health.

    AI: The Ultimate Automator, But Can It Be Your Lead Generator?

    

    
        **AI is transforming the real estate industry, but can it do more than just automate processes? Can it actually bring in leads that convert?**

        Most real estate agents use artificial intelligence to automate emails, follow-ups, and social media posts. However, the real advantage is using AI as a lead generation tool that attracts buyers and sellers without manual effort. If you are a real estate professional looking to optimize your marketing and bring in more leads, understanding AI's role in this process is essential.

    

    
        ## How AI Can Generate Real Estate Leads

        
        Automation can handle the follow-up process, but first, you need the leads. AI can be a powerful tool for lead generation when used correctly. Here are some ways real estate agents can use AI to increase lead flow:

        
            - **Data-Driven Content Creation:** AI analyzes MLS trends, market shifts, and pricing patterns, allowing you to create relevant content that attracts buyers and sellers.

            - **SEO and Social Media Optimization:** AI-powered tools generate keyword-rich blog posts, captions, and video scripts, helping your content rank higher in search engines.

            - **Automated Lead Engagement:** AI chatbots and CRM systems nurture and qualify leads 24/7, ensuring that every inquiry receives a response.

            - **Predictive Analytics:** AI can track online behavior and identify high-intent buyers and sellers before they even reach out.

            - **AI-Enhanced Video Marketing:** AI tools assist with scriptwriting, auto-editing, and scheduling, making it easier to maintain a consistent online presence.

        

    

    
        ## How AI is Changing Lead Generation for Agents

        In this video, I discuss the real power of AI in real estate marketing and why many agents are not using it to its full potential. Watch below:

        
    

    
        ## The Catch: AI Will Not Replace the Best Agents

        
        AI can help bring leads to your inbox, but converting them into clients requires skill and action. The best agents respond immediately when a lead comes in. If you hesitate, AI will not fix that problem. However, if you use AI for targeted marketing and engagement, your lead pipeline will remain strong.

        AI is not here to replace real estate agents. Instead, it is a tool that allows top-performing agents to scale their business more efficiently.
