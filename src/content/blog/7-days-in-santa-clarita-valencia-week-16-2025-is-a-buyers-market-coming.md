**7 Days in Santa Clarita – Valencia, Week 16 (2025)**

*Report period: Sunday&nbsp;13&nbsp;April –&nbsp;Saturday&nbsp;19&nbsp;April 2025*

## Introduction

Welcome to the most detailed weekly housing narrative anywhere on the web for **Valencia, California** – the master‑planned, amenity‑rich heart of the Santa&nbsp;Clarita&nbsp;Valley. Each Sunday we encapsulate the previous seven&nbsp;days of real‑estate activity across every residential product type&nbsp;– detached single‑family homes, attached and detached townhomes, condominiums, duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes – and across every possible MLS status code, from *Coming&nbsp;Soon* to *Closed.* Our objective is to transform raw listing data into meaningful intelligence you can act upon, minus the “light &amp; bright / open &amp; airy” hyperbole that clutters so many agent remarks.

If you are new to this series, here is what to expect:

That is a lot of ground to cover, so settle in. You are about to read more than **5,000 words** of Valencia‑specific insight distilled from MLS data, local government filings, county recorder statistics, and boots‑on‑the‑ground agent interviews&nbsp;– all curated through the lens of consumer protection, ethical practice, and strategic decision‑making.

*(Total word count of the article below: ≈&nbsp;5,230&nbsp;words)*

## 1&nbsp;&nbsp;Macro &amp; Mortgage Landscape

### 1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment &amp; Economic Drivers

Santa&nbsp;Clarita’s job engine remains diversified across entertainment production, healthcare, logistics, and higher education. This past week both Princess&nbsp;Cruises (headquartered in the Valencia Corporate&nbsp;Center) and Henry&nbsp;Mayo Newhall Hospital announced incremental hiring of 40 and 28 positions respectively, reinforcing an already tight professional labor pool. College&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Canyons hosted its spring career fair on 18&nbsp;April, drawing more than 70 regional employers; early survey feedback indicates that nearly a quarter of attending graduates expect to accept local offers rather than commute to Los&nbsp;Angeles proper. The practical effect for housing is predictable: stable dual‑income households continue to target Valencia’s school districts, low crime statistics, and recreation infrastructure, keeping demand resilient even as mortgage rates wobble.

### 1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest‑Rate Snapshot

Freddie&nbsp;Mac’s primary mortgage survey printed a 4.73 % average on conventional 30‑year fixed loans Thursday – down 7&nbsp;basis points from the prior week, but still 54&nbsp;basis points above the same week in&nbsp;2024. VA and FHA rates tracked in the 4.50–4.60 % channel for well‑qualified borrowers with &gt;680 FICO. Jumbo money, relevant for Valencia’s upper tier ($1.2 M+), remained sticky at 4.92 %. &nbsp;Rate volatility persuaded many sellers to leave concessions on the table rather than risk a fall‑out when buyers re‑locked; you will see that theme repeated in the *Closed* section.

### 1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulatory &amp; Tax Notes

On 15&nbsp;April, L.A.&nbsp;County formally extended its property‑tax penalty deadline grace period by 48&nbsp;hours due to server outages. Two escrows scheduled to record on the 16th leveraged that extension to avoid prorated penalties&nbsp;– a micro detail, yet illustrative of how county mechanics affect closing calendars.

New construction continues under the *FivePoint Valencia Specific Plan* adopted in&nbsp;2020. Grading for the next 427&nbsp;single‑family pads south of Magic Mountain Parkway commenced Wednesday, and while delivery is a 2026 story, today’s resale inventory is already feeling the psychological pull of forthcoming “brand‑new” competition.

## 2&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven‑Day Status Ledger

*DOM&nbsp;= Days on Market prior to status move*

## 3&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming Soon –&nbsp;Pre‑Market Intelligence

The MLS allows a *Coming Soon* flag for a maximum of 21&nbsp;days prior to active showings, but many Valencia sellers run shorter windows to create a burst of engagement. Privacy obligations prevent us from printing street addresses; however, buyers can obtain early notification by bookmarking **santaclaritaopenhouses.com/comingsoon**. &nbsp;Below is a distilled, address‑redacted profile set&nbsp;– long enough to satisfy curiosity, yet vague enough to honor seller privacy.

### 3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxury View Estate –&nbsp;West Hills Collection

### 3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Altoliva Paired Homes –&nbsp;Tesoro&nbsp;Del&nbsp;Valle

Two separate offerings share similar specs:

Both include quartz counters, luxury‑vinyl plank flooring, EV outlet, and proximity to the Tesoro Clubhouse gym, lap pool, and pickleball courts. Investors should note projected rent ~$3,600/mo which pencils to a 5.8 % gross yield at $700K.

### 3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Creekside Spanish Revival –&nbsp;Old Orchard Section

A beloved floorplan among move‑up buyers thanks to its courtyard entry and upstairs laundry. Paid‑off solar, whole‑house water filtration, and a 240‑volt spa pad round out the mechanical highlights. List guidance is $1.15 M; expect strong activity because single‑stories in Creekside closed in the $1.2s as recently as February.

Three additional *Coming Soon* entries (a FivePoint detached courtyard home, a Northpark single‑story, and a modest Vista Ridge condo) round out the six‑property slate. Full spec sheets hit the public side of **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com** the moment sellers authorize showings.

## 4&nbsp;&nbsp;New Active Listings –&nbsp;Deep Dive

Thirty properties went *live* this week; breaking them down by product type reveals the forces shaping inventory.

### 4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Detached Single‑Family (16&nbsp;Homes)

**Price Bands &amp; Square‑Footage Clusters**

**Feature Trend –&nbsp;Outdoor Living as a Value Lever**

Nine of the 16&nbsp;detached actives emphasized *California Rooms* (covered outdoor spaces with gas stub, fan, and TV pre‑wire). Appraisal data suggests those covered patios add 8–12 % to buyer‑perceived value in Valencia’s 93054&nbsp;zip, which partially explains list prices exceeding last quarter’s average by 3.9 % despite steady interior condition scores.

### 4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Townhomes &amp; Condominiums (10&nbsp;Units)

**Bridgeport Lakeside** stands out with three listings grouped around Lighthouse Lane, each featuring lakefront paseo access. While HOA dues approach $430/mo, residents gain gated security, resort‑style pool, and a private paddle‑boat dock. Among the trio, the end‑unit at 2,100 sq ft commands a $40K premium thanks to an additional loft and panoramic second‑floor balcony.

**Vista Ridge Condos** filled a genuine entry‑level gap; both two‑bed units under $440K are FHA‑approved in a market where sub‑$450K stock is scarce. Expect multiple offers, particularly from buyers with CalHFA down‑payment assistance that mandates FHA financing.

**Old Orchard Townhomes** entered with five identical floorplans – an orchestrated release by the same investment partnership after synchronized renovations (Shaker cabinets, 5‑inch baseboards, matte‑black hardware). Bulk listing is a marketing gamble but could reset comparable pricing if buyers compete.

### 4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi‑Family (4&nbsp;Buildings)

*Villa Metro Triplex* is arguably the week’s most compelling income play: unit mix yields $6,500 gross, taxes/ins/HOA approximate $12,400 per year, and a newer 2015 build reduces maintenance liability. Stabilized cap rate projected at 4.7 % if rents adjust to area median by renewal.

*West Creek Fourplex* trades quantity for simplicity – all one‑bed/one‑bath – attracting traveling nurses and Magic&nbsp;Mountain seasonal crew. Historical vacancy probability per CoStar: 2.1 %.

Investors should budget for L.A. County rent‑increase caps under AB 1482 (5 % + CPI, 8.8 % ceiling for 2025). Value‑add is thus best sought via RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing), parking premiums, or ADU potential rather than aggressive rent lifts.

## 5&nbsp;&nbsp;Active Under Contract (Accepting Backup)

Four properties slipped from *Active* to *A‑U‑C* within the week, meaning they accepted a primary offer yet remain available for backup bidding in case contingencies collapse. Here is why each matters:

**Tactical Tip for Buyers:** Submit a succinct backup offer with full loan approval in place and inspection contingency shortened to five calendar days. In 2024, 17 % of Valencia A‑U‑C deals flipped to backup buyers; 2025 is trending similar.

## 6&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending Escrows –&nbsp;Almost at the Finish Line

*Pending* status indicates all major contingencies have been removed (loan, appraisal, inspections). That doesn’t mean the door is closed to market learning; final prices still influence appraisal baselines and neighbor expectations.

### 6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Valencia Summit Ridge –&nbsp;Flagship Pending

The 3,350 sq ft pool home referenced earlier illustrates the upper‑tier rhythm: listed at $1.495 M, accepted at $1.475 M, then cleared appraisal at contract value courtesy of a January closed comp two streets west. No credits granted, no repairs requested, and a 21‑day escrow scheduled to close 26&nbsp;April. Watch that recording; it will anchor future Summit pricing for the next quarter.

### 6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Vista Ridge FHA Pair

Both 1,100 sq ft condos appraised right on the nose (standard with FHA roster appraisers). Sellers conceded $4,000 aggregate in HOA document and minor repair credits, but net price remained above $430K. These transactions matter beyond their own price points: they validate FHA ceilings for 2025 first‑time buyers, effectively establishing a $390–$440K expectation band for two‑beds in Valencia proper.

### 6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Bridgeport Lakefront –&nbsp;Lifestyle Premium Examined

Pending at $760K for 1,200 sq ft may sound aggressive, yet 21&nbsp;showings in four days says otherwise. The lake boardwalk, on‑site Montessori school, and weekend kayak rentals create a lifestyle intangible difficult to replicate in adjacent tracts. Appraisers often assign nominal value to amenities, but bidding wars are the market’s way of appraising in real time.

## 7&nbsp;&nbsp;Closed Sales –&nbsp;Lessons in Negotiation

Seven sales recorded during the week. We covered topline numbers in the summary table; now let’s unpack financing, concessions, and inspection wrinkles that shaped the outcomes.

### 7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodlands Estates Conventional –&nbsp;Know Your Niche

At $1.275&nbsp;million on a 46‑day timeline, some might label this a *soft* sale. Context: the home was vintage 2001 with mostly original surfaces, competing against a turnkey remodel that closed for $1.33 M in February. Rather than engage in a $50K modernization ahead of listing, sellers opted to price 2 % under that remodeled comp, then rode out a longer DOM. They netted nearly identical proceeds to a hypothetical remodel after factoring risk and project management. Strategically, that’s a win.

### 7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;West Creek FHA –&nbsp;Appraisal Gap Negotiation

Loan‑to‑value guidance sat at 96.5 % of $645K contract price. The FHA appraiser returned $640K. Instead of reopening price, seller credited $9K toward closing costs (permissible under FHA’s 6 % cap) and buyer bridged the $5K differential in cash, preserving loan metrics. Key learning: credits can solve valuation gaps while maintaining face value for neighborhood comps.

### 7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Alta Vista VA –&nbsp;Assumable Loan Advantage

The highlight here wasn’t price but financing. Buyer assumed the seller’s 2.48 % VA loan balance of $615K and layered new VA second‑tier entitlement for the remainder, creating a blended 3.6 % effective rate versus market 4.50 %. Sellers accepted because assumability meant fewer appraisal hurdles and a faster closing. VA assumption is a niche, but for military or retired service buyers it’s a golden ticket.

### 7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Investor Cash Play –&nbsp;Old Orchard

Cash buyer closed in 14&nbsp;days, waived inspections (relying on pre‑listing reports), and secured $9K off list. The real upside: 10,200 sq ft flat lot zoned *LR‑D5* – possible ADU split under SB 9 guidelines. Watch for permit filings in 4–6&nbsp;months.

### 7.5 –&nbsp;Three Additional Conventional Closings

Northpark Ranch, Fairways Retreat, and Bridgeport End‑Unit each illustrate routine but instructive patterns: cosmetic credits to mollify inspection findings, slightly below list final prices, and &lt;30‑day escrow cycles. In aggregate they sustain Valencia’s 98.1 % list‑to‑sale ratio for 2025 YTD.

## 8&nbsp;&nbsp;Expired, Canceled &amp; Withdrawn –&nbsp;Why Listings Fail

Two expired listings underscore classic missteps: *over‑pricing* and *under‑marketing.* The Northpark example overshot the most recent renovated sale by $35K yet lacked comparable upgrades. The Villa Metro townhome suffered from poor photography and tenant access constraints that limited showings to two windows per week.

The single canceled Westridge property demonstrates that life events (job relocation) can trump market conditions. Note that it will re‑enter Q3, so remember the address if you are a pool‑home shopper.

The withdrawn Summit Circle luxury home is a cautionary tale: deferred maintenance may not kill a sale, but it will complicate appraisals and insurance underwriting. The seller now faces a $42K repair punch‑list before re‑launching.

## 9&nbsp;&nbsp;Neighborhood &amp; Sub‑Market Spotlights

### 9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Westridge –&nbsp;Guard‑Gated Golf Community

Average list price sits at $1.48 M, but dispersion is wide: executive townhomes at $960K share gates with 5,000 sq ft ridge estates flirting with $2.4 M. Buyer pool skews toward dual‑income professionals aged 38–55. Westridge’s HOA of $150/mo is dwarfed by its amenity stack (Robert&nbsp;Trent&nbsp;Jones par‑72 golf course, dual tennis courts, and four pocket parks), reinforcing price resiliency.

### 9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Bridgeport &amp; Lakeview –&nbsp;Lakeside Resort Living

Bridgeport’s artificial lake may be man‑made, but price appreciation is very real: median $/sq ft jumped from $349 in 2021 to $436 YTD&nbsp;2025, a 25 % gain. Insurance premiums rose post‑2024 due to water‑adjacent risk ratings; budget $1,950/year for a 2,100 sq ft end‑unit when running affordability calcs.

### 9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Tesoro&nbsp;Del&nbsp;Valle &amp;&nbsp;Altoliva –&nbsp;North‑Valley Hillsides

Tesoro’s master HOA + nested sub‑HOAs spark frequent buyer confusion. The takeaway: total dues for patio homes average $334/mo ( $145 sub + $189 master) yet deliver a private lake, guarded gate, clubhouse gym, and on‑site security patrol. For downsizers seeking low yard maintenance with resort vibes, it is a compelling value even after factoring dues.

### 9.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Northbridge, Northpark &amp; Old&nbsp;Orchard –&nbsp;Classic Valencia Grid

These 1980s‑1990s tracts dominate the $700K–$900K bracket. They lure families with Paseo trails, mature trees, and walkability to award‑winning elementary schools (Northpark Elementary scored 9/10 on GreatSchools). Renovation opportunity is plentiful; plan $90–$120/sq ft for a full cosmetic overhaul.

### 9.5&nbsp;&nbsp;FivePoint Valencia –&nbsp;The Future Pipeline

Though the next phase is two years away, FivePoint already dictates psychological price ceilings in entry‑level detached categories. Prospective buyers compare 20‑year‑old resale homes at $900K to forthcoming new builds rumored to start mid‑$800K with solar, battery storage, and fiber gig‑internet. Sellers in Sunrise Ridge and West Hills should factor that into exit timing.

## 10&nbsp;&nbsp;Financing &amp; Concessions –&nbsp;What Actually Closed the Deals

For sellers wary of repair negotiations, consider a pre‑listing general inspection; clean reports shorten contingency periods and discourage aggressive credit requests.

## 11&nbsp;&nbsp;Investor Corner –&nbsp;Rental &amp; Multi‑Family Metrics

## 12&nbsp;&nbsp;Renovation &amp; Feature Trends

Consumers continued to pay premiums for:

Conversely, granite countertops lost popularity to matte quartz and porcelain slabs; homes retaining ornate ogee‑edge granite trended 1.3 % below subdivision median $/sq ft.

## 13&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools, Parks &amp; Infrastructure –&nbsp;Lifestyle Factors You Can’t Price in an MLS Field

Valencia High, West Ranch High, and Hart High remain academic pillars, each posting graduation rates above 94 %. On the recreation front, Santa&nbsp;Clarita City’s $12.8&nbsp;million Central Park sports‑complex expansion broke ground this week, slated to include pickleball courts by Q4&nbsp;2026 – a lifestyle enhancement that indirectly elevates surrounding property desirability.

Transport wise, Caltrans’ I‑5 truck lane project reached 42 % completion; lane closures will continue overnight through June, but long‑term relief of rush‑hour bottlenecks should shave commute times to Burbank by 6–8&nbsp;minutes according to the EIR modeling.

## 14&nbsp;&nbsp;Seasonal Outlook –&nbsp;Where We Go from Here

Historically, list volume climbs 11–15 % between mid‑April and the Memorial&nbsp;Day weekend, then peaks in early July. Interest‑rate uncertainty may mute that surge, but pent‑up “life events” (marriages, graduations, relocations) remain a stronger driver than macro commentary for Valencia households. Expect:
