Good morning Santa Clarita, this is Connor MacIvor, Connor with Honor, bringing you the latest real estate updates from SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com. Today, we'll dive into the current market activity, trends, and what it all means for buyers and sellers.

## Market Overview

As of this morning, we have a total of 474 active listings on the market for sale across the Santa Clarita Valley. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the past week's activity:

	- **Coming Soon**: 5 properties

	- **New Listings**: 82 properties

	- **Price Changes**: 76 properties (over 90% are reductions)

	- **Back on Market**: 23 properties

	- **Active Under Contract**: 33 properties

	- **Pending**: 55 properties

	- **Closed**: 53 properties

	- **Expired**: 3 properties

	- **Cancelled**: 11 properties

	- **Put on Hold**: 7 properties

	- **Withdrawn**: 3 properties

## Key Market Insights

### Price Reductions

The significant number of price reductions (76) suggests sellers are adjusting expectations to align with current market conditions. Despite these reductions, it's important to note that this trend may not continue if interest rates stabilize or decrease.

### Interest Rates and Market Dynamics

Should interest rates drop, we could see a resurgence of the market conditions from 2020-2022, where properties often sold above asking price, and buyers had to make significant concessions, such as waiving appraisals and inspections.

### California Real Estate Contracts

Upcoming changes to the California real estate contracts, influenced by recent lawsuits, will affect commission structures. Sellers will now have more flexibility in deciding how much to pay their agents, while buyers may negotiate with sellers for agent commissions.

## Expert Advice for Buyers and Sellers

### For Buyers

In a market with fluctuating interest rates and competitive listings, it's crucial to:

	- **Secure Financing Early**: Lock in your mortgage rate as soon as possible to avoid potential increases.

	- **Be Ready to Move Fast**: Properties, especially in high-demand areas, move quickly. Work with a realtor who can help you act fast and navigate the market effectively.

	- **Understand Concessions**: Be prepared to negotiate and potentially make concessions to secure your desired property.

### For Sellers

If you're considering selling, keep these points in mind:

	- **Price Strategically**: With many properties seeing price reductions, set a competitive yet realistic price to attract serious buyers.

	- **Prepare Your Home**: Ensure your property is in top condition to stand out in a crowded market. Small upgrades can make a significant difference.

	- **Stay Informed**: Keep abreast of market changes, especially regarding interest rates and new real estate contract regulations.
