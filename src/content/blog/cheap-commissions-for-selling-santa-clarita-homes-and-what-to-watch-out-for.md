## 1. The Traditional Commission Structure

For decades, the “typical” commission on a real estate transaction in many U.S. markets was often quoted as **6% total**—broken down (in theory) as:

	- **3%** to the **listing agent** (representing the seller)

	- **3%** to the **buyer’s agent** (representing the buyer)

But let’s talk reality: **commissions have always been negotiable**. While tradition might cling to that 6% figure, the truth is that **no law or code enforces it**. Some agencies might quote 5%, others 4.5%, some 7%—it’s a market phenomenon influenced by local competition, the property’s price, and (often) what sellers have come to expect over the years.

### How Did 6% Become the ‘Standard’?

If you dig into real estate’s past, you’ll find that many brokerages used 6% as a comfortable number that allowed for an even split between the two “sides.” This easy math also matched older commission structures, where national brokerages standardized their fees. However, as technology, consumer awareness, and competition advanced, the old standard has grown fluid. In **Santa Clarita**, for instance, we might see commission splits that range from 4% total up to 7% or more—**always** subject to negotiation.

## 2. What Is a Fair Commission—and Are They Truly ‘Typical’?

A “fair” commission is one that **reflects the value** your agent provides. If the agent invests in:

	- **Professional photography**

	- **Expert staging**

	- **Aggressive online marketing**

	- **Negotiation mastery**

...then perhaps paying a certain total commission might be worth it, especially if the resulting final price is **thousands of dollars higher** than it would have been with a weaker marketing plan.

However, if your agent plops a sign on the lawn, posts on the MLS, and then **disappears like a desert mirage**, paying a high commission is questionable.

In **Santa Clarita**, the range commonly hovers between 4% and 6% total, with the listing agent deciding how much of that to **offer** (through the MLS) to the buyer’s agent. It might be 2% or 2.5%, or sometimes 3%. As the **seller**, you **have a voice** in these decisions. Don’t let an agent bully you by saying “This is how it’s always been.” Remember: **Commissions are negotiable**—always.

## 3. Commission Negotiations: Understanding Both Sides

Negotiating your agent’s commission calls for a **collaborative** dialogue. This is your **hard-earned money**—and it’s crucial you see a **return on investment** (ROI) for every fraction of a percent you pay.

### Why Sellers Might Want to Offer a Strong Buyer’s Side Commission

Even if you negotiate a lower overall commission, consider how a strong offering to the **buyer’s agent** can:

	- Incentivize more showings

	- Attract top-tier buyer agents who know they’ll be fairly compensated

	- Potentially lead to a faster sale

Conversely, offering a meager commission might reduce interest from buyer’s agents. Like all professionals, agents work for compensation, so if the competitor property next door offers a 2.5% commission while you only offer 1.5%, guess which property might get more agent attention?

*(But again—**Connor with Honor** is telling you the unvarnished truth, not trying to manipulate. My job is to serve you, not to nudge you into a commission that lines my own pockets. We’ll always discuss the best strategy for **your** goals—ethically and transparently.)*

## 4. Why Real Estate Agents Charge Commissions

Some folks wonder, “Why should I pay thousands just to sell my house?” or “What is this agent really doing that’s worth so much money?” Let’s break it down into understandable segments:

	- 
	**Marketing Costs**

	Quality agents invest heavily in professional photography, videography, staging consultation, digital ads, social media targeting, and listing syndications. Good marketing isn’t cheap.

	

	- 
	**Brokerage Fees**

	Agents share a cut with their brokerage, who provides office space, transaction coordinators, technology, and brand recognition.

	

	- 
	**Professional Expertise**

	Navigating negotiations, disclosures, home inspections, appraisals, and various local compliance regulations is tricky. A strong agent orchestrates the entire process.

	

	- 
	**Risk &amp; Liability**

	Real estate agents assume liability if something goes awry—like incorrectly drafting contracts or mishandling escrow timelines. Good agents pay for insurance, continuing education, and compliance resources.

	

### Why Does This Matter?

As a **home seller**, you want a **champion** who invests in your success. If you’re paying a higher commission, ask, “What are you doing for me that I can’t get from another agent at a lower rate?” For instance, do they have:

	- **A robust marketing machine**?

	- **Proven negotiation track records**?

	- **Long list of satisfied past clients**?

*(For more insights into the **Santa Clarita** real estate process, check out my [Real Estate Glossary](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/real-estate-glossary) for definitions of many terms. Knowledge is power, dear friend, and I love to help you **decode** real estate lingo!)*

## 5. Predatory Agents vs. Protective Agents—Your Knight on the Field

The real estate industry, like any profession, hosts a **wide spectrum** of personalities. There are:

	- **Predatory agents**, who see dollar signs first and clients second.

	- **Protective agents**—the “knights” who live and die by their oath to serve and protect.

I’m a **first responder** who spent years wearing a **badge**—standing up for those in need, navigating life-and-death circumstances. That discipline taught me the importance of **honor**. Real estate is far less dangerous physically, but financially, it can be a warzone of **shady deals** and **unmet promises**.

### Protecting Homebuyers and Sellers in Santa Clarita

Santa Clarita is a prime real estate market. But high demand can bring out questionable characters. When unscrupulous agents sense you’re new to the process, they might:

	- Pressure you into signing an **exclusive contract** without fully explaining the terms.

	- Encourage you to **overprice** your property to lock you into a lengthy listing agreement—only to push for price reductions later.

	- Offer **kickbacks** or “bonuses” to the buyer’s agent without your knowledge, ignoring the potential conflict of interest.

**Don’t be fooled.** A **protective** agent (like the fatherly, watchful voice I strive to be) will always keep your best interests at the forefront.

## 6. Evaluating a Real Estate Agent’s Prowess

A strong real estate agent in **Santa Clarita** or beyond should be able to articulate how they:

	- **Market** your property

	- **Negotiate** with finesse

	- **Protect** you from legal and financial mishaps

	- **Communicate** clearly (no ghosting, no confusion)

**Ask for examples** of situations where the agent overcame obstacles. For instance, maybe they faced a complicated **multiple-offer** scenario and soared above the competition, netting a higher price for the seller. Or perhaps they saved a deal from the brink of collapse by skillfully navigating repairs and contingencies.

## 7. Interviewing Agents: The Questions That Reveal Character

When you’re interviewing a potential agent—whether buying or selling—**don’t hold back**. You’re making what could be the **largest transaction** of your life. Here are some potent questions:

	- 
	**“How do you justify your commission rate?”**

	Give them the platform to explain precisely what marketing or negotiation strategies they’ll implement.

	

	- 
	**“How will you protect my interests if issues arise?”**

	Real estate is rarely smooth from start to finish. You want an agent who has a calm plan for handling unexpected pitfalls.

	

	- 
	**“Can you provide references or real scenarios showcasing your negotiation style?”**

	Don’t let them wiggle out with vague stories. Press for specifics.

	

	- 
	**“What have been your biggest career challenges or failures?”**

	Authentic humility reveals character. No one is perfect, but an agent who can’t admit failure might also hide crucial mistakes.

## 8. Buyers’ Representation: The Commission Question

If you’re a **buyer**, you might assume you don’t have to worry about paying the agent. After all, many real estate deals appear to make the **seller** pay the buyer’s agent. However, times are changing. Some markets push for “buyer-broker agreements,” effectively stating that if the seller doesn’t pay your agent the full negotiated rate, **you** might be on the hook for the difference. In other words, if your buyer-broker agreement says your agent’s compensation is 3% but the listing is only offering 2.5%, you’ll owe the extra 0.5%.

### Does This Mean You’re Actually Paying Commission as a Buyer?

Potentially, yes. Let’s say you buy a $600,000 home, but the listing only offers 2.5%. If your contract states your buyer’s agent must be paid 3%, that’s a difference of $3,000. If not covered in negotiations with the seller, you might pay it at closing.

*(For more on the evolving **mortgage rates** that might impact your monthly budget, check out [Mortgage Rates](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/mortgage-rates). Understanding the big picture of your finances and how commission might come into play is crucial before you sign on the dotted line.)*

## 9. Seller Perspectives: Are You Paying Too Much?

**Sellers**: Did you know you have a **legal right to negotiate** every aspect of that listing contract, including **commission**? No agent can mandate a non-negotiable figure. If they do, they’re going against **antitrust laws**.

That said, you’ll want to weigh the **agent’s experience** and **marketing budget**. An agent might say, “I charge 6% total, but here’s the multi-pronged approach I’ll use to expose your home to the maximum number of potential buyers. Additionally, I handle professional staging, photography, and targeted online marketing.” If that plan might net you $30,000 more in the sale, you might say, “Sign me up!”

On the other hand, if the agent in question is simply recycling the same old “MLS plus yard sign” technique, paying a standard or high commission might be akin to burning money. And if an agent tries to shame you for questioning them, that’s a **red flag**.

## 10. Transparency in Real Estate: Buyer-Broker Agreements and Beyond

One major shift in the real estate industry is the **increased push for transparency**. Regulators, associations, and consumer advocacy groups have demanded more clarity around how commissions work. This has led to the popularity of **Buyer-Broker Agreements**:

	- They outline **how an agent will be compensated**.

	- They specify the **duties and obligations** of both agent and buyer.

	- They usually define a **time period** of representation.

Before you sign, ensure the agreement includes a clause about **cancellation** if the agent doesn’t deliver on promises. This is your **escape hatch** to avoid being bound to an ineffective or unethical realtor.

## 11. Behind the Scenes: Where Does Your Commission Dollar Go?

It’s easy to see commissions as a big chunk of change that vanishes into the agent’s pocket. But the breakdown might look like this:

	- **Broker Split:** Agents often share 10-50% with their brokerage.

	- **Marketing Costs:** Paid ads, flyers, mailers, open house expenses, staging consultation, and more.

	- **Professional Fees:** Board membership, MLS fees, insurance (E&amp;O coverage), continuing education.

	- **Operational Overhead:** Gas, phone, office supplies, internet, client gifts, etc.

After paying these bills, what remains is the agent’s net. For top-producing agents, that net can be very healthy. For less active agents, it can be shockingly small.

## 12. Connor with Honor: First Responder Realtor on Duty

I’m Connor with Honor, your local **Santa Clarita** real estate specialist and ex-first responder. My creed is:

	- **Honor above all**

	- **Service before self**

	- **Transparency at every turn**

I’ve dedicated my life to **protect and serve**—first in uniform, now on the real estate battlefield. I approach real estate with the same vigilance I had on the streets. When you walk into this potentially **stressful** process, I see it as my duty to shield you from unscrupulous tactics, hidden fees, and predatory practices. My vow? **Keep you safe**—financially, mentally, and emotionally—so you can realize your real estate goals **without regrets**.

## 13. Avoiding Common Pitfalls (and Predatory Tactics)

**Pitfall #1**: Signing a listing agreement that locks you in for six months without any performance guarantee.

**Pitfall #2**: Accepting an agent’s marketing plan at face value—ask for specifics!

**Pitfall #3**: Not clarifying how **dual agency** works. If your listing agent also represents the buyer, is that in your best interest? Possibly—but get clarity on how they plan to remain neutral.

**Pitfall #4**: Letting an agent “overprice” your home to make you feel good, only to push you for painful price reductions week after week.

In each scenario, the solution is the same: **Be informed.** Ask questions. Insist on accountability. If an agent balks, that’s your sign to run.

## 14. Negotiating Tactics to Maximize Savings

When you’re on the **selling side** and thinking, “I want to pay less in commission,” consider the following negotiation tips:

	- 
	**Leverage Competition**

	Interview at least three agents. Let them know you’re exploring options. Sometimes just the mention of “I’m talking to multiple agents” motivates them to sharpen their pencil.

	

	- 
	**Look at Performance**

	If one agent has sold homes for far above the average market price or in **faster-than-usual** time, a slightly higher commission might be justified, because their performance adds direct value to your bottom line.

	

	- 
	**Tie Commission to Performance**

	Some creative sellers say, “I’ll pay you 5% if you sell my home for at least $X. If the final price is below $X, your commission is 4.5%.” This aligns your agent’s pay with their results.

	

	- 
	**Demand a Marketing Budget**

	If your agent claims a full-service approach, have them itemize the marketing plan. If they balk, ask them to reduce their commission.

	

**Remember**: You want to remain fair, too. Agents do a lot of work behind the scenes, and you want them motivated to represent your property with vigor.

## 15. The Shift in Modern Real Estate: From 3% Each Side to…?

We’re in the middle of a **tectonic shift** in how commissions are structured. Recent class-action lawsuits and changes in multiple listing services (MLS) policies have begun clarifying that buyers can, and sometimes should, **negotiate** how buyer’s agents are paid. Some brokerages even pivot to **flat-fee** or **hourly** models.

What might this look like in the near future?

	- **Flat-Fee Listings**: You pay a set fee for marketing, open houses, and negotiation.

	- **Hourly Rates for Agents**: Some might only charge you for the hours spent on your file.

	- **A La Carte Services**: Want professional staging? That’s an extra $X. Need a 3D tour? Another $X.

Is that necessarily better or worse? It depends on you. Some folks prefer an all-inclusive approach, while others like paying only for the specific services they need.

## 16. How to Research Agents’ Track Records

Here’s a fatherly tip: **Always research**. Type an agent’s name into Google. Check their reviews on **Zillow** (though be cautious—some unscrupulous folks might “game” the system). See if they have real reviews on **Yelp** or **Google My Business**. Also check **local** Santa Clarita community forums or Facebook groups. Additionally, ask them to provide a list of recent transactions. If they’re proud of their success, they’ll happily share.

*(I keep a robust section of success stories on [My Sold Listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/my-sold-listings). Transparency is key; seeing what’s been done in the past can help you gauge how an agent might serve you in the future.)*

## 17. The SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com Edge

Why do I emphasize **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com** in the midst of discussing commissions? Because having a **centralized, local** website can provide an **immense** advantage. When you list your home with me, it’ll gain prime placement on a site specifically designed to capture leads and traffic from serious Santa Clarita buyers. And guess what?

	- We **don’t** push you through relentless pop-ups or funnel you into a massive chain of “referral agent calls.”

	- We respect your **privacy** and keep your data safe.

	- We’ve got direct **local** listings (like [Active Listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings)), specialized location searches (e.g., [Canyon Country Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/canyon-country-homes)) for hyper-focused house hunters, and more.

**SEO** is all about building **trust** and giving potential buyers an easy, straightforward search platform that isn’t riddled with hidden ads or inaccurate listings. That’s exactly what you’ll find.

## 18. SEO Boost: Linking to Valuable Resources on SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com

## 19. Community-Focused: Santa Clarita, Canyon Country, Valencia, and More

Serving Santa Clarita means understanding each **community’s heartbeat**. Canyon Country has a different vibe than **Valencia**, which differs still from **Newhall**, **Saugus**, **Stevenson Ranch**, or outlying areas like **Acton** and **Agua Dulce**. The commission you negotiate might reflect the local norms or the property’s unique value proposition.

**Example**: If you’re selling a **horse property** in **Acton** (see [Horse Properties in Santa Clarita Valley](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/horse-properties-for-sale-in-santa-clarita-valley-ca)), that requires specialized marketing to a more niche audience. A strong listing agent who invests time, money, and knowledge in effectively marketing that type of property is invaluable.

*(Community is everything. I see it as my duty to keep the neighborhoods informed and safe. If you want to know about open houses in your community, check out [Santa Clarita Open Houses Today](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-open-houses-today-1).)*

## 20. Building a Long-Term Relationship with Your Realtor

The best agent-client relationships often **extend beyond** the transaction. My clients call me months later asking for:

	- Contractor recommendations

	- Advice on property tax appeals

	- Ideas about whether to refinance

	- Updates on local market changes

I welcome it! That’s part of the fatherly role I enjoy. If you only hear from your agent when they’re angling for a new listing or searching for a new buyer, that’s a sign they see you as a **transaction**, not a **relationship**. We all know relationships flourish with **constant communication** and mutual respect.

## 21. The Future of Real Estate Commissions

As the industry continues to evolve, more platforms and consumer advocacy groups push for **a clearer, more transparent** breakdown of commissions. In some areas:

	- Buyers pay their own agents directly.

	- Sellers pay only for the listing side.

	- The buyer’s agent commission might appear on settlement statements more explicitly.

We’re also seeing the rise of **discount** brokerages, but with “discount” can come **discounted** (read: minimal) service. If you go the discount route, just confirm you know exactly what you’re getting. Sometimes, the cheaper route ends up being the costliest if your property sells for far less than it could have, or if you fail to snag your dream home because your discount agent wasn’t fully engaged.

I believe in a **model** that merges:

	- **Full transparency** of fees.

	- **High-level** service, anchored in **honor** and **expertise**.

	- The **client’s best interest** always in mind, including creative ways to structure commissions so that your goals remain the top priority.

## 22. Final Thoughts &amp; Key Takeaways

We’ve covered a sprawling range of topics, from the old 3% + 3% model to the intricacies of modern buyer-broker agreements and the shifting tides of **real estate commissions**. As your protective knight in shining armor, I want to ensure you enter this domain armed with **knowledge** and supported by a sincere advocate who **cares** about your outcome.

Here are the **critical points** to remember:

	- 
	**All Commissions Are Negotiable**

	Never let anyone tell you otherwise. The reason it used to be “standard” at 6% was more tradition than law.

	

	- 
	**Value Over Price**

	If you’re going to pay a certain commission, be sure the agent’s marketing efforts and negotiation skills match the fee.

	

	- 
	**Interview Multiple Agents**

	Look for the one whose approach and ethics align with your comfort zone. Ask direct questions and expect direct answers.

	

	- 
	**Protect Yourself**

	Predatory tactics exist. You can avoid them by insisting on **transparency**. Watch out for “smoke and mirrors” or vague marketing promises.

	

	- 
	**Know Who Pays the Buyer’s Side**

	With new policy changes, you might be responsible for paying part of your agent’s commission if the seller doesn’t offer the full rate. Clarify this in your contract.

	

	- 
	**Check Track Records**

	Past performance (and real client testimonials) is often the best predictor of how you’ll be treated.

	

	- 
	**Local Expertise Matters**

	**Santa Clarita**, **Valencia**, **Canyon Country**, **Newhall**, **Acton**, and **Agua Dulce** are unique. Hire an agent who truly knows these communities and invests in them.

	

	- 
	**I’m Here to Help**

	As a first responder turned realtor, I take your well-being seriously. My mission is to shield you from pitfalls, stand guard over your best interests, and ensure your real estate journey is **successful, transparent,** and **fulfilling**.

We’ll have a fatherly talk, clarify your objectives, and ensure you’re on the **right path**.

Until then, friend, keep your **spirit light** and your **mind sharp**. With the knowledge from this guide, you’re well on your way to forging a successful real estate path—one free from hidden agendas and dark corners.

**You** are in control of your real estate destiny.

I’m simply here to shine a light and protect you from the dragons lurking in the shadows.

	- 
	**Scenario: Seller Interviewing Agents**

	
		**Seller**: “Connor, I have an agent who says they’ll list my home at 5% total, but you mentioned 6%. Why should I consider your higher commission?”

		- **Connor**: “My 6% includes an itemized marketing plan: professional staging, photography, 3D tours, social media ad campaigns, and weekly open houses. The other agent, who only charges 5%, might just put your home on the MLS. Historically, I’ve netted sellers an extra 3–5% on final sales price because of my marketing approach. If you do the math, that extra 1% commission can lead to an overall bigger profit. If the other agent invests zero in marketing, you risk attracting fewer buyers, leading to price reductions or longer days on market.”

		- **Seller**: “When you put it that way, the difference in net proceeds is more important than the difference in commission.”

		- Moral of the story: **Be sure your agent’s higher commission yields a higher overall sale price.**

	

	
	- 
	**Scenario: Buyer Facing a Buyer-Broker Agreement**

	
		**Buyer**: “Connor, the new buyer-broker agreement states that if the listing only offers 2.5%, I must pay you the extra 0.5%. Is that standard?”

		- **Connor**: “We’ll always talk about that up front. There might be ways to negotiate with the seller to cover it, especially if you’re offering a strong purchase price. Transparency is key: I want you to know precisely what to expect.”

		- **Buyer**: “That’s fair. Thanks for telling me ahead of time, so there won’t be last-minute financial surprises.”

		- Moral of the story: **Honest, upfront communication about who pays what fosters a trusting agent-buyer relationship.**

	

	
	- 
	**Scenario: Choosing Commission Splits**

	
		**Seller**: “I want you to keep 2%, but offer 3% to the buyer’s agent. That might attract more buyers, right?”

		- **Connor**: “Yes, it often does. But let’s consider synergy. If you only pay me 2%, that might cap my marketing budget. On the other hand, 2.5% for me and 2.5% for the buyer’s agent might strike a balance. Ultimately, we’ll test both approaches and see how the market responds. That’s the beauty of negotiation—no ironclad rules.”

		- Moral: **Commission splits can be allocated differently to maximize exposure.**

	

	
	- 
	**Scenario: A Predator Agent Emerges**

	
		**Buyer**: “I just met an agent who said if I buy with them, they’ll cut me a check from their commission. That seems great, but is it legit?”

		- **Connor**: “It might be legal depending on local laws, but is that agent focusing more on giving you a quick bonus or providing thorough representation? If they’re ready to give a slice of their commission, are they shortchanging something else, like adequate property research or negotiation?”

		- Moral: **Cash incentives from an agent aren’t always a sign of altruism; they can point to a minimal-service approach.**

	

	
	- 
	**Scenario: The Informed Seller**

	
		**Seller**: “Before I list, I want to see your entire track record of sales in Saugus over the past two years—final sales price vs. listing price.”

		- **Connor**: “Absolutely. Let’s hop on my [Saugus Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/saugus-homes) link to see current listings, then compare to my sold data. Transparency is my motto. You’ll see if my listings typically sold at or above the list price, or if my approach effectively minimized days on market.”

		- Moral: **Demand data from your agent to back up their claims.**

	

	
	- 
	**Scenario: Commission Tied to Performance**

	
		**Seller**: “I’ll pay you 5% if you sell above $700,000, but if it sells under $700,000, let’s reduce your pay to 4.75%. Do you agree?”

		- **Connor**: “That’s a performance-based approach. I can accept that because I’m confident in my marketing. Keep in mind, if market shifts hamper the final price, that’s not always my fault, but let’s craft a strategy that’s fair to both sides.”

		- Moral: **Performance-based commissions can align interests, but they require a mutual understanding of market fluctuations.**

	

	
	- 
	**Scenario: Buyer Doesn’t Want to Sign a Representation Agreement**

	
		**Buyer**: “I prefer to stay ‘free agent.’ Why do I need to sign anything?”

		- **Connor**: “Because we’re establishing trust and accountability. I want you to know that I’m contractually obligated to represent your best interests. Without a written agreement, you might find agents who vanish or push you around. This agreement protects both of us—like a seatbelt. You only realize how valuable it is when you need it.”

		- Moral: **Written agreements can offer clarity and protection for buyers and agents alike.**

	

	

### Additional Insights: SEO, Ethics, and the Santa Clarita Market

**Why so many references to the local area and internal links?** Because we want to:

	- Help you (the client) see all relevant resources.

	- Show Google and other search engines that we have robust content about local real estate.

	- Prove that we’re not a generic “nationwide aggregator,” but a **hands-on local** presence in Santa Clarita.

**Ethical** real estate is about shining a light on everything, from how commissions are structured to how you can exit a contract if you’re unhappy. If your agent is doing things right, they have nothing to hide. They’ll emphasize clarity at every step.

When searching for a home—be it in **Newhall**, **Valencia**, or **Saugus**—a local website like SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com is your friend. We maintain up-to-date listings, detailed property info, hyperlocal tips, **market reports** (e.g., [Canyon Country Market Report](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/canyon-country-market-report), [Valencia Market Report](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/valencia-market-report), and so forth), giving you an advantage you might not get using a broader portal that lumps Santa Clarita in with the rest of Los Angeles County.

### The Fatherly Sarcasm and Wisdom

You know that fatherly stance: “I wouldn’t let you run into traffic without telling you cars exist, would I?” In real estate, I don’t want you stepping into the “busy street” of real estate deals without seeing the “speeding cars” of unscrupulous practice. My fatherly sarcasm might come out like: “Of course, if you love setting your wallet on fire, you can sign a 7% commission with the next agent you meet at Starbucks who promises the world but disappears on inspection day.” But you won’t do that. Because I’m here to **guide** you and you’re too smart to get swindled.

**Patience** is key. Just like being a father taught me to hold a child’s bike seat while they find their balance, I’ll hold your hand through the complicated parts of buying or selling. And yes, once you find that balance, you might coast along without me—but I’ll always be a phone call away if you hit a bumpy patch.

### A Note on Memorization, Digestion, and Comprehension

Real estate commissions can feel complicated—like reading a foreign dictionary. Here’s how to **memorize, digest, and comprehend**:

	- **Bullet Points**: Jot down the top five aspects of commissions. (Who pays, how much, what’s negotiable, how it’s split, any new policies.)

	- **Visualize**: Picture a scenario. If you’re a seller listing your home at $600,000, what does 2.5% or 3% mean in real dollar terms?

	- **Practice**: If you’re not in the market yet, pretend you are. Run the numbers. See how you’d handle an agent negotiation.

	- **Repeat**: Read this post again in a few days. The repetition cements the knowledge.

*(Pro tip: This method helped me when I studied for real estate exams and hostage negotiator courses. Repetition plus real-world scenarios = mastery.)*

### The NOW Mindset

A final fatherly push: **Don’t procrastinate**. Whether you’re about to list or buy tomorrow, next month, or even next year, start preparing **now**. Real estate markets shift with economic changes, interest rate fluctuations, and local developments. Having a firm grasp of commission structures and agent responsibilities isn’t just beneficial, it’s crucial. If you wait until you’re signing a listing agreement, the pressure might lead you to a suboptimal decision.

**Right now** is the best time to:

	- Interview prospective agents.

	- Explore how commissions might vary in your neighborhood.

	- Look at how local market conditions (like new construction or seasonal changes) might affect your negotiation leverage.

## Concluding With Honor

**Honor** is the cornerstone of everything I do. I wore it on my badge as a police officer, and I wear it now on my real estate name badge. I’m passionate about **Santa Clarita** because it’s a community I deeply care for—a place where families thrive, businesses flourish, and we watch out for each other. My mission is to ensure everyone I serve in real estate is **thoroughly protected, consistently informed, and supremely satisfied**.

Remember, you wield the **power** in your real estate transactions. Your agent—**Connor with Honor**, or whomever you choose—serves **you**. If they forget that, gently remind them or find someone else. This might be a once-in-a-lifetime move for you, so it deserves the **utmost care** and **respect**.

May your real estate endeavors be guided by clarity, empowered by knowledge, and sealed with success. If you ever need me, your fatherly ex-cop-turned-realtor, I’m just a **click** or **call** away.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
