# How Do I Know If My Santa Clarita Real Estate Agent Is Actually Working for Me?

## TL;DR

Your real estate agent should respond within 24 hours, provide weekly updates, show you every property that fits your criteria, present all offers to sellers, and negotiate aggressively on your behalf. If they're dodging calls, hiding listings, or pressuring you into bad deals, they're not working for you—they're working for their commission check. Red flags include: no communication plan, refusing to explain their strategy, pushing you toward properties that benefit them, and disappearing after you sign. Connor MacIvor, a former LAPD officer turned Santa Clarita realtor, breaks down exactly how to hold your agent accountable and what to demand before you hire them.

## The Conversation Every Santa Clarita Buyer and Seller Needs to Have

**You:** I hired a real estate agent three weeks ago, and I feel like I'm doing all the work. Is this normal?

**Connor:** Absolutely not. If you're the one finding listings, scheduling showings, and chasing down answers, your agent isn't doing their job. Let me ask you—when you hired this person, did they give you a clear communication plan?

**You:** What's a communication plan?

**Connor:** Exactly my point. A communication plan is a written agreement that says: "I will respond to your calls and texts within X hours. I will send you new listings every X days. I will update you on market changes weekly." If your agent didn't give you this upfront, they're already failing you.

**You:** They told me they'd "stay in touch," but I haven't heard from them unless I reach out first.

**Connor:** That's the number one complaint I hear from buyers and sellers who come to me after firing their first agent. Here's the truth: real estate agents work on commission. Some agents will sign you up, disappear, and only resurface when they think you're ready to close a deal. That's not service—that's laziness.

**You:** So how do I know if my agent is actually working?

**Connor:** Great question. Let's break it down.

## The 7 Non-Negotiable Signs Your Santa Clarita Agent Is Actually Working for You

### 1. They Respond Within 24 Hours (Or Sooner)

If your agent takes 48+ hours to return a call or text, they're either overwhelmed or they don't prioritize you. In Santa Clarita's competitive market, waiting two days for an answer could mean losing your dream home.

**What you should expect:**

	- Response within 4-6 hours during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM)

	- Evening/weekend response within 24 hours

	- Auto-reply if they're unavailable (with backup contact info)

**Red flag:** They only respond when YOU initiate contact, or they go silent for days at a time.

**Why this matters in Santa Clarita:** Homes in Valencia, Saugus, and Stevenson Ranch are moving fast. If your agent is slow to respond, you'll miss out on [homes for sale in Valencia](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-valencia-ca) and [Saugus properties](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-saugus-ca) before you even get a chance to tour them.

### 2. They Send You New Listings BEFORE You Find Them on Zillow

Your agent should be sending you properties that match your criteria every single day. If you're finding homes on Zillow that your agent never mentioned, they're not doing their job.

**What you should expect:**

	- Daily or every-other-day emails with new listings

	- Off-market and "coming soon" properties you can't find online

	- Explanations for why certain homes fit (or don't fit) your needs

**Red flag:** You're the one sending THEM listings and asking, "What about this one?"

**Why this matters in Santa Clarita:** Santa Clarita has [active listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings) that change daily. A good agent monitors the MLS in real-time and gets you access to [coming soon listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/comingsoon) before the competition even knows they exist.

### 3. They Give You a Clear Strategy (And Stick to It)

A real agent doesn't just "show you houses." They build a game plan based on your budget, timeline, and priorities—and they execute it.

**What you should expect:**

	- A written buyer or seller strategy within the first week

	- Clear milestones (e.g., "We'll tour 5-7 homes this week, submit offers by Friday")

	- Regular check-ins to adjust the plan based on market conditions

**Red flag:** They're "winging it" or can't explain why you're looking at certain neighborhoods over others.

**Why this matters in Santa Clarita:** [Neighborhoods like Canyon Country](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-canyon-country-ca) have different price points, school districts, and HOA structures than [Stevenson Ranch](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-stevenson-ranch-ca). Your agent should know which areas align with your goals and explain the trade-offs.

### 4. They Negotiate Like Their Own Money Is on the Line

When you make an offer, your agent should fight for every dollar. If they're immediately agreeing to the seller's terms without pushback, they're rushing to close the deal—not protecting your wallet.

**What you should expect:**

	- Comps and market data to justify your offer price

	- Negotiation on price, repairs, closing costs, and concessions

	- A willingness to walk away if the deal doesn't make sense

**Red flag:** They pressure you to "just accept" the counteroffer or tell you "this is as good as it gets" without showing proof.

**Why this matters in Santa Clarita:** The difference between a weak agent and a strong negotiator can save you $10,000-$30,000 on a [Santa Clarita home purchase](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/buyers-guide). I've been through LAPD hostage negotiation training—I know how to create leverage and get sellers to move.

### 5. They Show You EVERY Home That Fits Your Criteria (Not Just the Ones That Pay Them More)

Some agents will steer you toward listings that offer higher commissions or are easier to sell. That's called steering, and it's unethical.

**What you should expect:**

	- Access to every listing in your price range and preferred neighborhoods

	- Honest feedback about pros and cons of each property

	- Transparency about commission structures (especially post-NAR settlement)

**Red flag:** They avoid showing you certain homes or say "that one's not a good fit" without a valid reason.

**Why this matters in Santa Clarita:** Whether you're looking at [Castaic homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-castaic-ca), [Newhall properties](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-newhall-ca), or [Acton land](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-acton-ca), you deserve to see everything that matches your needs—not just what's convenient for your agent.

### 6. They Warn You About Problems (Even If It Means Losing the Sale)

A great agent will tell you when a home has red flags—even if it means you walk away and they don't get paid.

**What you should expect:**

	- Honest assessments of property condition, neighborhood issues, and resale potential

	- Recommendations for inspections, surveys, and due diligence

	- A willingness to say "I don't think you should buy this"

**Red flag:** They downplay obvious issues or rush you through inspections to "keep the deal moving."

**Why this matters in Santa Clarita:** Homes in areas like [Agua Dulce](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-agua-dulce-ca) may have well or septic issues. Homes in fire zones may have insurance challenges. A good agent discloses these risks upfront—not after you're in escrow.

### 7. They Treat You Like Their Only Client (Even Though You're Not)

Your agent should make you feel like a priority, not an afterthought.

**What you should expect:**

	- Dedicated time for showings, calls, and strategy sessions

	- Availability on weekends and evenings (when most buyers are free)

	- A team or assistant if they're juggling multiple clients (so you're never ignored)

**Red flag:** They cancel showings last-minute, show up late, or seem distracted during appointments.

**Why this matters in Santa Clarita:** Real estate moves fast here. If your agent is stretched too thin, you'll lose out on [Santa Clarita open houses](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-open-houses-today) and time-sensitive opportunities.

## FAQ: Holding Your Santa Clarita Real Estate Agent Accountable

### Q: How often should my agent update me on the market?

**A:** At minimum, weekly. A proactive agent will send you market updates, new listings, and strategy adjustments every 5-7 days. If the market shifts (like a sudden increase in [inventory](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-market-report) or interest rate changes), they should notify you immediately.

### Q: What if my agent isn't returning my calls?

**A:** Document every missed call and unanswered text. After 48 hours with no response, send a formal email stating: "I have not heard back from you in X days. I need a response by [date] or I will need to terminate our agreement." If they still don't respond, contact their broker and request a new agent or termination of the contract.

### Q: Can I fire my real estate agent?

**A:** Yes, but it depends on your [buyer broker agreement](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/buyers-guide). Most agreements have termination clauses. Review your contract and look for language about cancellation. If your agent is breaching the contract (not communicating, not showing you homes, etc.), you have grounds to terminate. Contact their broker to escalate the issue.

### Q: What should I do if my agent is pressuring me to make an offer?

**A:** Push back. Ask: "Why do you think this is the right home for me?" and "What are the downsides?" A good agent will respect your hesitation and provide data to support their recommendation. If they can't justify the pressure, it's a red flag. You're in control—not them.

### Q: How do I know if my agent is steering me toward certain properties?

**A:** Ask them directly: "Are you showing me every home in my price range, or are you filtering based on commission?" Post-NAR settlement, agents must disclose commission structures upfront. If they're evasive or defensive, that's a problem. Demand transparency.

### Q: Should my agent attend every inspection and appraisal?

**A:** Yes. Your agent should be present (or have a team member present) at inspections, appraisals, and final walkthroughs. If they're "too busy" to attend, they're not prioritizing your transaction. These are critical moments where issues can arise—your agent needs to be there to protect you.

### Q: What if my agent didn't disclose a problem with the home?

**A:** If your agent knew about an issue (foundation problems, title defects, neighborhood concerns) and didn't tell you, that's a breach of fiduciary duty. Document everything and consult a real estate attorney. You may have grounds for a lawsuit or complaint with the California Department of Real Estate.

### Q: How can I verify my agent's track record in Santa Clarita?

**A:** Ask for recent sales data in your target neighborhoods. Check their reviews on Google and [testimonials](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/testimonials). Request references from past clients. A legitimate agent will have no problem providing proof of their experience in [Valencia](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/valencia-market-report), [Saugus](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/saugus-market-report), and other Santa Clarita areas.

### Q: What's the difference between a buyer's agent and a listing agent?

**A:** A buyer's agent represents YOU and your interests. A listing agent represents the seller. Some agents will try to represent both sides (dual agency), which creates conflicts of interest. Always ask: "Who are you working for in this transaction?" If they say "both of you," walk away.

### Q: Can I negotiate my agent's commission?

**A:** Yes. After the NAR settlement, buyer's agent commissions are negotiable. Discuss this upfront and get it in writing. Some agents offer tiered services (full-service vs. limited-service) at different price points. Don't be afraid to ask what you're paying for and whether there's flexibility.

## How Connor MacIvor (Former LAPD) Keeps Santa Clarita Agents Accountable

I spent 20 years on the streets of Los Angeles as an LAPD officer. I learned how to read people, de-escalate conflict, and negotiate under pressure. When I transitioned to real estate, I brought those skills with me—and I use them to protect my clients from bad agents.

Here's how I do it differently:

### 1. I Vet Every Agent in My Network

I don't refer you to just any agent. I personally vet each realtor in my [agent network](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/about) based on:

	- Response time (I test them before I refer)

	- Negotiation skills (I review their past deals)

	- Ethics and transparency (I check their DRE record and reviews)

If an agent doesn't meet my standards, they don't get referrals. Period.

### 2. I Hold Agents Accountable After the Referral

Just because I refer you to an agent doesn't mean my job is done. I check in with you throughout the process to make sure the agent is performing. If they're dropping the ball, I intervene and either get them back on track or find you a replacement.

### 3. I Educate Buyers on What "Good Service" Actually Looks Like

Most people don't know what to expect from an agent because they've never bought a home before. I provide a [buyer's guide](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/buyers-guide) and [educational resources](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/learn) so you know exactly what your agent should be doing—and when to call them out for failing.

### 4. I Leverage My Law Enforcement Background to Negotiate Harder

Hostage negotiation training isn't just for life-or-death situations. The same principles apply to real estate: build rapport, create leverage, know when to push and when to walk away. I coach the agents I refer to use these tactics—and buyers love it because they save money.

### 5. I Don't Take a Cut from the Agent

Some referral services take a percentage of the agent's commission, which creates an incentive to refer high-commission agents over the best agents. I don't do that. My referrals are based solely on who will serve YOU best—not who pays me the most.

## What to Do If Your Current Agent Isn't Working Out

If you're reading this and realizing your agent is failing you, here's what to do:

### Step 1: Document Everything

Save every text, email, and voicemail. Make notes of missed appointments, unanswered questions, and broken promises. You'll need this if you escalate the issue.

### Step 2: Have a Direct Conversation

Before you fire them, give them one chance to fix the problem. Send an email like this:

"Hi [Agent Name],

I've noticed some communication gaps over the past few weeks. I need to make sure we're aligned on expectations. Can we schedule a call to discuss my concerns and create a plan moving forward? If we can't resolve this, I may need to explore other options.

Thanks, [Your Name]"

If they ignore this message or make excuses, move to Step 3.

### Step 3: Contact Their Broker

Every agent works under a broker. Find the broker's contact info (it should be on the agent's business card or website) and send them a formal complaint. Explain the issues and request either a new agent or termination of your contract.

### Step 4: Terminate the Agreement (If Necessary)

Review your buyer broker agreement for termination clauses. Most agreements allow you to cancel with written notice. If your agent is breaching the contract, you have legal grounds to walk away. Consult a real estate attorney if needed.

### Step 5: Find a Better Agent

Don't make the same mistake twice. This time, interview multiple agents and ask the tough questions:

	- What's your communication plan?

	- How many clients are you working with right now?

	- Can I see recent sales data in my target neighborhoods?

	- What's your strategy for finding off-market deals?

	- How do you handle negotiations?

If they can't give clear answers, keep looking.

Or skip the guesswork and [schedule a consultation with me](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/contact). I'll match you with a vetted agent who meets my standards—or if you prefer, I'll represent you myself.

## Summary: The 7 Signs Your Agent Is Actually Working for You

	- **They respond within 24 hours** (or have a backup plan if unavailable)

	- **They send you listings proactively** (not the other way around)

	- **They have a clear strategy** (and adjust it based on market conditions)

	- **They negotiate hard** (and can prove it with data)

	- **They show you every home that fits** (no steering or hidden agendas)

	- **They warn you about problems** (even if it costs them the sale)

	- **They make you feel like a priority** (not an afterthought)

If your agent isn't doing these things, it's time to have a conversation—or find someone new.

## Final Thoughts: You Deserve Better Than "Just OK"

Real estate is the biggest financial decision most people ever make. You shouldn't have to wonder if your agent is working for you or just collecting a paycheck.

In Santa Clarita, where homes in [Valencia](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-valencia-ca), [Saugus](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-saugus-ca), [Stevenson Ranch](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-stevenson-ranch-ca), [Canyon Country](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-canyon-country-ca), and [Castaic](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-castaic-ca) are selling fast, having the right agent isn't optional—it's essential.

If you're frustrated with your current agent, or you're just starting your search and want to avoid hiring the wrong person, [reach out to me](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/contact). I've spent 20 years in law enforcement protecting people. Now I do it in real estate.

Let's make sure your agent is actually working for you.

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
