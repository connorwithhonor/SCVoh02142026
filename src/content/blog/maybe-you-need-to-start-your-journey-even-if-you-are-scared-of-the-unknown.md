# Maybe you need to start your journey even if you are scared of the unknown

**Breaking Free: A Blueprint for Young Adults Stuck in Routine**

As we step into 2025, life feels like it's moving at the speed of light. Technology is everywhere, and it’s easier than ever to get lost in the virtual worlds of video games, social media, and endless scrolling. For some, this has become the routine: wake up, grab the phone, plug into the virtual matrix, and let the day blur by. If that sounds like you—if you're in your late teens or early 20s and feel like life isn’t going anywhere—this message is for you.

I’m not your parent, and I’m not here to give you a lecture. But if you’ve ever wondered why you feel stuck, unmotivated, or unsure of your next move, then it might be time to shake things up. Not with a drastic overhaul or some kind of dramatic life change—but by starting small. Let’s talk about how you can break free, one small change at a time.

### 1. **Recognizing the Rut: The Power of Small Changes**

If your daily life has become a predictable loop, it might be time to ask yourself: is this what you want your life to look like a year from now? Five years from now? It’s not about feeling guilty or blaming yourself—it’s about understanding that the routine you’re in today is shaping your tomorrow.

Think about it: what’s the first thing you do when you wake up? Do you reach for your phone, check notifications, and dive into a stream of TikToks or gaming highlights? Maybe your mornings are a blur of habits you barely think about—brushing your teeth, sitting down at your computer, and getting lost in a digital world. That’s not necessarily wrong, but if it’s not helping you grow, it’s time for a change.

Here’s the thing: you don’t have to completely upend your life overnight. Start small. Maybe, instead of heading straight for your computer or phone, you step outside. Just for a minute. Take a deep breath. Look around. Feel the air on your face. It doesn’t sound like much, but it’s a start. Sometimes, breaking free from a rut starts with the simplest of actions.

### 2. **The Importance of Stepping Outside**

Why step outside? Why not just start your day differently inside the comfort of your home? The answer is simple: there’s something powerful about connecting with the real world.

When you step outside, you’re breaking the physical and mental boundaries of your routine. Even if you’re not planning to run a marathon or hit the gym, just breathing fresh air and feeling the ground under your feet can wake something up inside you. It reminds you that there’s a world beyond the screen—a world that’s full of possibilities, connections, and challenges that can help you grow.

Start small. Walk out to the front of your house and just *be* there for a moment. Notice the trees, the cars driving by, the sound of birds or wind. This isn’t about becoming a nature enthusiast overnight—it’s about reconnecting with reality. When you make this a habit, even for just a few minutes a day, you’ll start to notice a shift in how you feel. The fog of routine starts to lift, and suddenly, life feels a little more vibrant.

### 3. **The Courage to Face the World**

If you’re feeling stuck, you’re not alone. It’s natural to feel scared or overwhelmed when you think about stepping out into the “real world.” Let’s be honest: the world can be a mean and nasty place. People can be selfish, life throws curveballs, and success isn’t guaranteed. But here’s the good news: none of that matters as much as how you respond to it.

The key isn’t avoiding challenges—it’s learning how to get knocked down and get back up again. That’s what separates the people who succeed from those who stay stuck. The world isn’t going to hand you success, and no one is going to care about your dreams as much as you do. That might sound harsh, but it’s also empowering. It means you’re in control. You have the power to decide how you show up, how you respond to setbacks, and how you move forward.

### 4. **From Virtual Mastery to Real-Life Success**

Let’s talk about video games for a second. If you’re good at online games, you already have the skills to succeed in real life—you just don’t know it yet.

Think about what it takes to master a game: strategy, focus, resilience, and the ability to adapt. When you fail a mission or lose a match, you don’t throw the controller and give up forever (well, maybe for a few minutes, but you come back). You learn from your mistakes, adjust your strategy, and try again. That’s exactly what life is like.

Life is the ultimate game, and the rewards are bigger than unlocking a new skin or leveling up your character. In real life, leveling up means finding your purpose, building relationships, and creating a future you’re proud of. The same focus and determination you use in gaming can be applied to your goals—whether it’s getting a job, learning a new skill, or simply becoming the best version of yourself.

### 5. **Shifting Your Mindset: It’s Not About Perfection**

One of the biggest mistakes people make when trying to change their lives is thinking they need to make huge, dramatic moves right away. But real change doesn’t happen like that. It’s not about hitting a home run on your first swing—it’s about taking one small step at a time.

Maybe your first step is just getting out of bed a little earlier. Maybe it’s walking to the end of your driveway. Maybe it’s spending five minutes researching a career path that interests you. Whatever it is, start small and build from there. The momentum you create will carry you forward.

It’s also important to be kind to yourself along the way. You’re not going to be perfect, and that’s okay. You’re going to make mistakes, hit roadblocks, and feel frustrated at times. But those moments aren’t failures—they’re opportunities to learn and grow.

### 6. **The Truth About Success: Nobody’s Coming to Save You**

Here’s a hard truth: nobody’s going to do the work for you. Nobody’s going to hand you the life you want on a silver platter. The people around you might care about you, but at the end of the day, they’re focused on their own lives. And that’s not a bad thing—it just means you need to take responsibility for your own journey.

The world is full of people who will try to take advantage of you. Some will have their hand out, asking for something, while their other hand is in your pocket. But that doesn’t mean you should avoid the world altogether. It means you need to be smart, stay focused, and keep your guard up. Play the game, but play it wisely.

### 7. **Final Thoughts: You’ve Got This**

If you’ve made it this far, you already know what you need to do: start small, step outside, and take control of your life one step at a time. It’s not going to be easy, and it’s not going to happen overnight. But if you’re willing to put in the effort, you’ll be amazed at what you can achieve.

Remember, life is a game, and it’s one worth playing. The rewards are real, the challenges will test you, and the victories will mean more than anything you’ve experienced in a virtual world. So get out there. Take a breath of fresh air. Make one small change today. And when you’re ready, make another.

You’ve got this. See you in the real world.

Let’s start a movement of young people stepping out of their comfort zones and building lives they’re proud of. Until next time, I’m Connor—your guide to real life, one step at a time.
