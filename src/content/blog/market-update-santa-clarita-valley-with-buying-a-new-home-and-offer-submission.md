## Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Update: Your Comprehensive Guide for Buyers and Sellers

(Offersubmission below)

Welcome to your go-to resource for real estate updates in the Santa Clarita Valley, brought to you by *Connor with Honor*, your trusted First Responder Realtor. With Santa Clarita’s dynamic market, it’s crucial to have an expert on your side who knows the area, understands the trends, and values transparency and trust. Here’s everything you need to know about buying, selling, and staying informed on Santa Clarita real estate.

### Why Santa Clarita?

The Santa Clarita Valley is one of Southern California’s most sought-after regions. Known for its family-friendly neighborhoods, excellent schools, outdoor recreational spaces, and vibrant local culture, Santa C![](https://idx-acnt-ihouseprd.b-cdn.net/AR1197716/file_manager/Trashing%20offers%20first%20responder%20realtor%20connor%20with%20honor%20santa%20clarita%20real%20estate%20square.png?width=350&amp;height=350&amp;aspect_ratio=350%3A350)larita offers a high quality of life without the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles. The cities of **Castaic, Canyon Country, Newhall, Saugus, Stevenson Ranch, and Valencia** each offer unique features, making the area appealing to a wide range of buyers—from first-time homeowners to luxury seekers.

### Market Snapshot: Current Trends in Santa Clarita Real Estate

If you’re looking for a quick overview of the current real estate landscape, here’s what we’re seeing this week:

	- 
	**Total Active Inventory**: As of now, there are **553 active residential properties** across the Santa Clarita Valley, including single-family homes, townhomes, and condos. Each neighborhood has its unique dynamics, and staying updated on inventory helps both buyers and sellers understand the competition.

	

	- 
	**7-Day Activity Breakdown**:

	
		**Coming Soon**: 12 properties

		- **New Listings**: 59 properties

		- **Price Changes**: 89 properties

		- **Back on Market**: 24 properties

		- **Active Under Contract**: 32 properties

		- **Pending**: 31 properties

		- **Closed Sales**: 46 properties

		- **Expired Listings**: 8 properties

		- **Canceled Listings**: 14 properties

		- **On Hold**: 9 properties

		- **Withdrawn**: 0 properties

	

	

Each category has its significance, from “coming soon” listings giving buyers a head start, to “expired” or “canceled” listings that reflect sellers’ changing plans. For detailed insights into what these trends mean for you, read on.

### For Buyers: Making the Most of the Santa Clarita Market

Whether you’re a first-time homebuyer, an investor, or looking to upsize or downsize, understanding how to approach the market is essential. Here are some crucial tips for navigating today’s real estate climate.

#### 1. **Stay Alert for New Listings and “Coming Soon” Properties**

Santa Clarita is a competitive market, and properties can move fast. To stay ahead, regularly check “coming soon” listings on **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com**. These are properties that are not yet fully available but will be on the market soon. By signing up for alerts on upcoming properties, you’re in a stronger position to prepare financing, schedule viewings, and make an informed decision as soon as they go live.

*Pro Tip*: Properties in the “coming soon” stage sometimes have sellers who are testing the market, which can lead to opportunities for serious buyers ready to act fast.

#### 2. **Understand Price Changes and What They Signal**

In a typical week, Santa Clarita might see around 89 price adjustments. A price change can signal various things—a motivated seller, a property that’s lingered on the market, or even a seasonal adjustment. Buyers who watch these changes closely often have an edge in negotiations, especially if they’re prepared to move quickly.

#### 3. **Leverage Back-on-Market Opportunities**

With 24 properties returning to the market, there’s often a story behind each one. Sometimes, it’s due to financing issues or inspection concerns that derailed the deal. These properties can be an opportunity for buyers who may have missed out initially. Additionally, sellers may be more receptive to offers after a failed escrow, so don’t be afraid to revisit properties that catch your interest.

#### 4. **Get Pre-Approved to Speed Up the Process**

Sellers in Santa Clarita often prioritize offers from buyers who have financing pre-approval. In a fast-moving market, being pre-approved can be the difference between securing a home and losing out to another buyer. Not only does this demonstrate your commitment, but it also helps you identify a price range that aligns with your budget.

#### 5. **Work with a Local Expert**

Santa Clarita is a diverse area, and each neighborhood has its own trends. Working with an experienced agent like myself, who knows Santa Clarita’s communities in and out, will ensure you get insights into the best areas for your lifestyle, budget, and long-term goals. From luxury properties in Stevenson Ranch to family homes in Saugus, having a local expert is invaluable.

### For Sellers: How to Navigate the Santa Clarita Market Like a Pro

Selling a home requires strategy, timing, and the right representation. Here’s what Santa Clarita sellers should keep in mind to maximize their chances of a successful sale.

#### 1. **Price it Right the First Time**

A key component of any sale is pricing. Overpricing can lead to a property sitting on the market too long, which may make it less attractive to potential buyers. Underpricing, however, can undervalue the property and lead to leaving money on the table. Reviewing recent sales in the area and comparable properties helps in setting a fair and competitive price.

*Fun Fact*: Homes that are priced correctly from the start often sell faster and closer to the asking price than those that go through multiple price reductions.

#### 2. **Capitalize on “Coming Soon” Listings**

The “coming soon” status is an excellent marketing tool, providing your property with early exposure before it hits the market. This phase lets interested buyers start planning showings and even prepare offers ahead of time, which can result in quicker sales once the property becomes officially available.

#### 3. **Prepare for Multiple Offer Situations**

Santa Clarita’s market often sees multiple offers, especially for properties in high-demand neighborhoods. As your Realtor, I’ll help you evaluate each offer beyond the price, considering contingencies, buyer financing, and timelines. A high offer with loose financing can sometimes be riskier than a slightly lower cash offer, for example.

#### 4. **Watch Expired and Canceled Listings**

If your property is struggling to gain traction, reviewing expired and canceled listings in your area can be insightful. Understanding why similar properties didn’t sell might reveal areas for improvement, whether it’s pricing, staging, or marketing.

#### 5. **Stay Ready for Showings**

The Santa Clarita market is competitive, and buyers are eager. Keep your property in showing-ready condition, as buyers can request viewings on short notice. Cleanliness, staging, and even minor upgrades can make your home stand out. As your First Responder Realtor, I prioritize strategic timing and presentation to ensure your home shows at its best.

### Understanding Market Trends: How Do They Affect You?

#### **Seasonal Variations**

Real estate tends to have seasonal ebbs and flows. Spring and summer often bring a wave of new listings and active buyers, while fall and winter can see reduced activity. However, Santa Clarita’s market remains relatively consistent throughout the year, making it a dependable area for both buyers and sellers.

#### **Interest Rates and Market Impact**

Interest rates play a significant role in buyer behavior. Lower rates increase affordability, encouraging more buyers to enter the market. Higher rates, however, can slow down sales slightly as monthly payments increase. Keeping a close eye on interest rate trends can help buyers and sellers time their moves effectively.

#### **Inventory and Demand Dynamics**

The balance of inventory and demand is critical. When inventory is low, sellers benefit from higher prices and faster sales. In contrast, higher inventory gives buyers more options and room for negotiation. Santa Clarita currently maintains a healthy balance, offering opportunities for both sides.

### Chapter and Verse: Submitting Offers to the Seller (NAR Code of Ethics, Article 1, Standard of Practice 1-7)

According to the National Association of Realtors® (NAR) **Standard of Practice 1-7**, a Realtor® must present **all offers and counteroffers to their client until the closing or lease execution**. This means that no matter how high, low, or unconventional the offer might seem, a Realtor® is ethically bound to submit it to the seller. Here’s the exact language from Standard of Practice 1-7:

"When acting as listing brokers, REALTORS® shall continue to submit to the seller/landlord all offers and counter-offers until closing or execution of a lease unless the seller/landlord has waived this obligation in writing. Upon the written request of a cooperating broker who submits an offer to the listing broker, the listing broker shall provide, as soon as practical, a written affirmation to the cooperating broker stating that the offer has been submitted to the seller/landlord, or a written notification that the seller/landlord has waived the obligation to have the offer presented."

This section reflects NAR’s dedication to **client autonomy, transparency, and trust**. Realtors® cannot unilaterally decide which offers are “worthy” of consideration based on personal judgment or preferences. The code requires them to respect the client’s right to make decisions about their property.

### Why Standard of Practice 1-7 Exists: Protecting Sellers' Rights and Promoting Transparency

Standard of Practice 1-7 exists to protect the seller’s right to know about every potential opportunity, regardless of whether the Realtor® believes it’s a good offer. By keeping sellers informed, the standard ensures that no offer slips through the cracks and that the seller remains in control.

Here’s why this standard matters:

	- 
	**Transparency**: Sellers need complete visibility to make informed decisions. Every offer provides information about the current market, buyer motivations, or potential negotiation tactics.

	

	- 
	**Client Control**: Only the seller can determine what is in their best interest. Some buyers make low initial offers with room to negotiate, and some sellers may appreciate even an unconventional offer if it aligns with their goals, such as a cash buyer or a fast close.

	

	- 
	**Market Dynamics**: When sellers review each offer, they can gauge interest in their property and respond strategically. For example, a lower-than-expected offer could prompt the seller to adjust pricing, enhance marketing, or prepare a counteroffer.

	

In short, Standard of Practice 1-7 is in place to ensure that sellers have all the necessary information to make their own choices about their property.

### Situations Where Sellers May Waive the Submission Obligation

In some cases, a seller may choose to waive the obligation to receive all offers in writing, especially when they’re firm on a specific price threshold or terms. However, this waiver must be documented in writing. Here are some scenarios where a seller might waive this requirement:

	- 
	**Price Thresholds**: Sellers might request to see only offers above a certain price. This helps them avoid seeing what they consider “lowball” offers, though it’s important to weigh the potential value of any offer as a starting negotiation point.

	

	- 
	**Specific Buyer Profiles**: A seller might want to avoid certain conditions, such as contingent offers, and could waive the presentation of those specific offer types.

	

	- 
	**Short Listing Timeline**: For sellers with a tight timeline, viewing only pre-qualified, high-value offers could expedite the decision process.

	

It’s crucial to note that even with a waiver in place, sellers should thoroughly discuss the potential risks and missed opportunities with their Realtor®.

### Realtors® and Written Affirmations: Keeping Everyone Informed

When a cooperating broker (representing the buyer) submits an offer, they may request a written confirmation that their offer was presented to the seller. According to Standard of Practice 1-7, the listing broker must promptly provide this confirmation in writing, stating that the offer was indeed submitted. This verification process protects both the buyer’s and seller’s interests, upholding the integrity of the transaction.

In situations where a seller has waived the right to see all offers, the listing broker must notify the cooperating broker of this fact in writing. This ensures that all parties are on the same page, reducing the likelihood of miscommunication.

### Real-Life Applications of Standard of Practice 1-7 in Santa Clarita’s Market

In Santa Clarita’s competitive real estate market, Standard of Practice 1-7 can play a pivotal role. Here’s how:

	- 
	**Buyers Testing the Market**: Buyers often submit initial offers below asking price to see where the seller stands. Even if an offer seems “offensive” or well below market value, presenting it may provide valuable feedback. A low offer could spark a negotiation, prompt counteroffers, or motivate other interested buyers to submit their best offers.

	

	- 
	**Multiple Offers**: In a multiple-offer scenario, every single offer must be presented, ensuring transparency and giving the seller a full spectrum of choices. Reviewing multiple offers allows sellers to compare not only prices but also terms, timelines, and contingencies.

	

	- 
	**Expired or Canceled Listings**: For sellers whose properties have been on the market for an extended period, receiving all offers becomes even more essential. Reviewing every offer helps determine whether adjustments in pricing, marketing strategy, or property presentation are necessary to attract the right buyer.

	

	- 
	**Cash Offers and Quick Sales**: Some cash-buying companies make offers quickly but may come in lower than market value in exchange for speed and simplicity. Sellers need to see these offers to weigh the benefit of a fast sale against their financial goals. Even though these offers might be lower, they can provide value for sellers needing quick closings or fewer contingencies.

	

### Final Thoughts on Standard of Practice 1-7

Standard of Practice 1-7 is more than a rule; it’s a reflection of the Realtor’s® duty to act in the seller’s best interest, providing transparency and respecting their autonomy. For sellers, it’s a reminder that your Realtor® is there to serve you, keeping you informed and empowered at every stage.

For a Santa Clarita seller, knowing that every offer—no matter how low or high—is presented means that you’re always in the driver’s seat. At *SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com*, my commitment as your First Responder Realtor® is to uphold these standards and provide you with clear, honest communication, so you’re fully informed and confident in every decision about your property.
