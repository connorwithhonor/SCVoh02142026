**INTRODUCTION**

Most people spend more time researching which car to buy than which real estate agent to hire.

That's insane.

Your car depreciates the second you drive it off the lot. Your home (hopefully) appreciates and becomes your largest financial asset. Yet people will test-drive five cars and interview zero agents before signing a listing agreement or buyer representation contract.

I'm Connor MacIvor. I've been in Santa Clarita real estate since 1998—27 years of watching great agents change lives and terrible agents destroy financial futures. Before that, I spent 20 years with LAPD, so trust me, I can spot BS from a mile away.

Here's the reality: **most agents are mediocre**. They'll sell or buy you a house, sure. But will they negotiate the best deal? Will they catch problems during inspection? Will they guide you through complex decisions? Probably not.

The good news? **You can identify a top-tier agent in a 30-minute conversation if you ask the right questions.**

This article gives you exactly those questions—the ones that separate elite agents from average ones. These aren't softball questions like "How long have you been an agent?" These are the questions that make mediocre agents squirm and great agents light up.

By the end of this, you'll know exactly how to interview agents, what red flags to watch for, and how to choose someone who'll actually protect your interests instead of just chasing a commission.

Let's get into it.

**WHY MOST PEOPLE HIRE THE WRONG AGENT**

Before we get to the questions, let's talk about why most people screw this up.

**THE THREE MOST COMMON MISTAKES:**

**1. They hire a friend or family member**

"My cousin's a Realtor!" Cool. Is your cousin a GOOD Realtor? Are they responsive? Do they negotiate hard? Do they know Santa Clarita inside and out? Or are you hiring them because you feel guilty saying no?

Spoiler: Most people hire friends/family and regret it halfway through the transaction but can't fire them because Thanksgiving would be awkward.

**2. They hire the first agent they meet at an open house**

Open house agents are often the NEWEST agents in the office. Why? Because experienced agents don't have time to sit at open houses—they're busy closing deals. So you're hiring someone with 6 months of experience because they smiled at you while you toured a house.

**3. They hire based on personality instead of competence**

"She was SO nice!" Great. But did she explain the contract? Did she know the neighborhood comps? Can she negotiate with a shark of a listing agent? Or is she just nice and completely ineffective?

Nice doesn't close deals. Competent does.

**THE 15 QUESTIONS YOU MUST ASK (AND WHY THEY MATTER)**

Here's your interview script. Don't skip any of these.

**QUESTION #1: "How many transactions have you closed in Santa Clarita in the past 12 months?"**

**Why it matters:**

Experience matters. A lot. An agent who closes 2-3 deals a year is a hobbyist. An agent who closes 15-30 deals a year is a professional.

**What you want to hear:**

"I closed 20 transactions last year, 15 of them in Santa Clarita."

**Red flags:**

	- Vague answers ("Oh, I've done a lot...")

	- Low numbers ("I closed 3 last year, but I'm really dedicated!")

	- Mostly outside Santa Clarita ("I'm licensed in Santa Clarita but I mostly work in Palmdale...")

**FOLLOW-UP:**

"How many of those were in my target neighborhood?" (Valencia, Saugus, Castaic, etc.)

**QUESTION #2: "Can you explain the difference between Mello-Roos and property taxes, and how it affects my monthly payment?"**

**Why it matters:**

Mello-Roos is a HUGE cost in Santa Clarita, especially in Valencia. If your agent doesn't understand it, they can't accurately estimate your monthly housing costs—and you'll be shocked at closing.

**What you want to hear:**

A clear explanation of Mello-Roos (special tax for infrastructure), how it's calculated, which neighborhoods have it, and how it affects affordability.

**Red flags:**

	- "I think it's like an extra tax or something?"

	- "Your lender will explain that."

	- Blank stare.

**FOLLOW-UP:**

"Which Santa Clarita neighborhoods have the highest Mello-Roos, and which have none?"

**QUESTION #3: "What's your average list-to-sale price ratio?"**

**Why it matters:**

This tells you if the agent prices homes correctly. If their average list-to-sale ratio is 95% or lower, they're consistently overpricing homes (which means longer time on market and eventual price drops). If it's 98-100%+, they're pricing accurately and getting offers.

**What you want to hear:**

"My average is 99-101%, depending on market conditions."

**Red flags:**

	- "I always list high to leave room for negotiation." (Translation: I don't know how to price homes and I waste your time.)

	- "I'm not sure, I don't track that." (Translation: I'm not data-driven.)

**QUESTION #4: "How do you determine a home's value? Walk me through your process."**

**Why it matters:**

Pricing is everything. Overpriced homes sit. Underpriced homes leave money on the table. You want an agent who uses data, not gut feelings.

**What you want to hear:**

"I pull comps from the past 3-6 months, adjust for square footage, lot size, condition, and upgrades. I analyze days on market, list-to-sale ratios, and current inventory levels. Then I factor in current buyer demand and position the home competitively."

**Red flags:**

	- "I just know the market." (Translation: I'm guessing.)

	- "We'll list it and see what happens." (Translation: I'm lazy.)

	- "I use Zillow's Zestimate as a starting point." (Translation: I have no idea what I'm doing.)

**QUESTION #5: "What's your communication style, and how often will I hear from you?"**

**Why it matters:**

Bad communication is the #1 complaint about real estate agents. You need to know upfront how responsive they'll be.

**What you want to hear:**

"I respond to texts/emails within 2 hours during business hours. I send weekly updates during the listing period and daily updates once we're in contract. You'll always know what's happening."

**Red flags:**

	- "I'm pretty busy, but I'll get back to you when I can."

	- "I prefer phone calls." (In 2026? Really?)

	- Vague answers with no specifics.

**FOLLOW-UP:**

"What happens if I text you at 8pm on a Saturday with a question?" (Great agents will have a system for after-hours communication.)

**QUESTION #6: "What's your strategy for negotiating in a multiple-offer situation?"**

**Why it matters:**

Santa Clarita is competitive. Multiple offers are common, especially on well-priced homes. You need an agent who knows how to win.

**What you want to hear:**

A detailed strategy involving escalation clauses, personal letters to sellers, flexible terms, waiving contingencies (when appropriate), and relationship-building with listing agents.

**Red flags:**

	- "We just offer more money." (Lazy and expensive for you.)

	- "We'll see what happens." (No strategy = you lose.)

**QUESTION #7: "What do you do differently that other agents don't?"**

**Why it matters:**

This separates average agents from elite ones. Average agents list on MLS and wait. Elite agents have a marketing plan, a network, and systems.

**What you want to hear (for sellers):**

"I hire a professional photographer and videographer, stage the home, create a custom property website, run targeted Facebook/Instagram ads, host broker previews, send direct mail to the neighborhood, and leverage my network of buyers and agents."

**What you want to hear (for buyers):**

"I have relationships with listing agents which gives us early access to listings. I set up custom MLS alerts so you see homes the second they hit the market. I preview homes for you to save your time. And I negotiate aggressively to get you the best deal."

**Red flags:**

	- "I just list it on MLS like everyone else."

	- No clear differentiators.

**QUESTION #8: "Can you walk me through a recent deal that went sideways and how you handled it?"**

**Why it matters:**

Things go wrong in real estate. Inspections reveal problems. Buyers back out. Appraisals come in low. You need an agent who can problem-solve under pressure.

**What you want to hear:**

A specific story with a problem, their solution, and the outcome. Shows experience, resilience, and creativity.

**Red flags:**

	- "I've never had a deal go wrong." (They're lying or inexperienced.)

	- Vague answers with no specifics.

**QUESTION #9: "How do you handle inspections? What's your process?"**

**Why it matters:**

Inspections kill deals or cost buyers/sellers thousands. You need an agent who understands inspections and knows how to negotiate repairs.

**What you want to hear (for buyers):**

"I recommend you get a full inspection, even in a competitive market. I'll attend the inspection with you, review the report, identify major vs. minor issues, and negotiate repairs or credits strategically."

**What you want to hear (for sellers):**

"I recommend a pre-listing inspection so we can address major issues before listing. This reduces buyer objections and keeps the deal moving."

**Red flags:**

	- "Inspections are a waste of money." (Incompetent and dangerous.)

	- "Just ask for everything to be fixed." (Unrealistic and ineffective.)

**QUESTION #10: "What neighborhoods in Santa Clarita do you specialize in?"**

**Why it matters:**

You want a specialist, not a generalist. An agent who knows Valencia inside and out might not know Castaic or Canyon Country.

**What you want to hear:**

Specific neighborhoods with clear knowledge of schools, HOAs, Mello-Roos, traffic patterns, and future development.

**Red flags:**

	- "I work all over Santa Clarita." (Translation: I'm not an expert anywhere.)

	- Can't name specific elementary schools, parks, or shopping centers in your target area.

**QUESTION #11: "What's your average days on market compared to the market average?"**

**Why it matters:**

Homes that sit too long lose value. Buyers assume something's wrong. You want an agent who moves homes quickly.

**What you want to hear:**

"My average is 15 days on market. The market average is 25 days."

**Red flags:**

	- Doesn't track this data.

	- Their average is higher than the market average.

**QUESTION #12: "How do you handle lowball offers?"**

**Why it matters (for sellers):**

Lowball offers are insulting, but sometimes they lead to a deal. You need an agent who won't let emotion kill a potential transaction.

**What you want to hear:**

"I present every offer to you with my recommendation. If it's a lowball, we counter strategically to gauge their seriousness. Sometimes lowball buyers become full-price buyers if handled correctly."

**Red flags:**

	- "I reject lowballs immediately." (Emotional decision-making.)

	- "We always counter at full price." (Ineffective negotiation.)

**QUESTION #13: "What's included in your commission, and are there any additional fees?"**

**Why it matters:**

Some agents charge extra for photography, staging, marketing, etc. You need to know total costs upfront.

**What you want to hear:**

"My commission is X%. That includes professional photography, MLS listing, marketing materials, open houses, and all transaction coordination. No hidden fees."

**Red flags:**

	- Extra charges for basic services.

	- Vague answers about costs.

**QUESTION #14: "Can I speak with your last three clients?"**

**Why it matters:**

References tell you everything. Great agents will happily provide them. Bad agents will make excuses.

**What you want to hear:**

"Absolutely. Here are their names and numbers."

**Red flags:**

	- "I can't share client info due to privacy." (Weak excuse.)

	- Provides references but they're all from years ago.

**FOLLOW-UP:**

Actually call the references. Ask: "Would you hire this agent again?" and "What's one thing they could have done better?"

**QUESTION #15: "If I'm not happy with your service, can I cancel our agreement?"**

**Why it matters:**

Some agents lock you into 6-month contracts with no escape clause. That's predatory.

**What you want to hear:**

"If you're not satisfied, you can cancel with X days' notice."

**Red flags:**

	- "Our contracts are binding for 6 months, no exceptions."

	- Defensive or irritated by the question.

**BONUS QUESTIONS (IF YOU WANT TO GO DEEPER)**

	- "What's the biggest mistake you see buyers/sellers make?"

	- "How do you stay up-to-date on market trends?"

	- "What technology or tools do you use to stay organized?"

	- "How do you handle multiple clients at once?"

	- "What's your backup plan if you're unavailable during my transaction?"

**RED FLAGS THAT SHOULD DISQUALIFY AN AGENT IMMEDIATELY**

	- **Part-time agent** (Real estate is their side hustle)

	- **Hasn't closed a deal in your target neighborhood in the past year**

	- **Pushes you to make quick decisions without explaining pros/cons**

	- **Doesn't return calls/texts within 24 hours during initial contact** (It won't get better once you hire them.)

	- **Uses high-pressure sales tactics** ("You need to sign today or you'll lose out!")

	- **Badmouths other agents or clients** (They'll badmouth you next.)

	- **Doesn't have errors and omissions insurance** (Run.)

**WHAT TO DO AFTER YOU INTERVIEW AGENTS**

	- **Interview at least 3 agents.** Never hire the first one you meet.

	- **Compare their answers** to the questions above.

	- **Check their online reviews** (Yelp, Google, Zillow). Look for patterns, not one-off complaints.

	- **Call their references.** This step is non-negotiable.

	- **Trust your gut.** Competence + communication + integrity = great agent.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

Here's the part where I tell you something most agents won't:

**You don't owe any agent your business just because they spent time with you.**

If you interview an agent and they're not a good fit, say "Thank you for your time, but I'm going to keep looking." That's it. No guilt. No apologies.

Your home is likely your biggest financial asset. You deserve an agent who's competent, responsive, and has your best interests at heart—not someone who's just chasing a commission.

I don't represent buyers or sellers anymore—I run a referral service that connects people with vetted agents who've proven they can deliver. Every agent in my network has been through a rigorous evaluation process and has a track record of success in Santa Clarita.

**Want to work with an agent I'd actually refer to my own family? Reach out. I'll match you with someone who'll earn your business, not expect it.**

**No referral fees. No pressure. Just honest guidance and a great agent.**

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
