Welcome to another installment of our **Santa Clarita real estate update**! I’m Connor with Honor, and I’m excited to guide you through the vibrant world of **Valencia, CA real estate**—one of the crown jewels of the **Santa Clarita Valley**. Whether you’re new to this region or you’ve lived here for decades, you’ve likely felt the energy and charm that permeate every corner of Valencia, from its master-planned communities and paseos to its excellent schools and robust local economy. Santa Clarita is a large valley that includes Valencia, Canyon Country, Saugus, Newhall, Castaic, Stevenson Ranch, Agua Dulce, and more. Yet, despite being only part of a larger region, Valencia often stands out as a sought-after enclave for homebuyers, investors, and families.

In this long-form blog post, I’ll be sharing **key market data** pulled from local listings and real estate statistics, giving you an **in-depth** look at how many properties are on the market, how long they’re staying up for sale, how their prices have shifted over the past several weeks and months, and what that means for you—whether you’re buying, selling, or simply watching from the sidelines. I’ll also dive deeply into **tips for maximizing your sale price**, securing the best mortgage financing, and understanding the sometimes **mysterious world of Mello-Roos** taxes. I’ve updated these insights for the coming year—2025—so you can stay ahead of the curve and plan your next move with confidence.

At the same time, if you’re one of those folks pre-qualified earlier in 2024 and you’ve been holding off until “the market changes,” it’s good news: Reconnecting with your lender is typically straightforward. You generally won’t need a complete re-qualification from scratch; a few updated documents and a conversation about current interest rates are often enough to bring you back up to speed. And for the sellers who are reading, we’ll talk about the changing tastes of homebuyers. Our world is evolving quickly, so certain décor or personal touches might not be as universally appealing as they once were. Removing excessive personal memorabilia, especially if it’s career-specific or overly bold, can help your property appeal to a wider audience of prospective buyers.

**Valencia** is an excellent vantage point for analyzing the **Santa Clarita real estate** market as a whole. With about 120+ active listings in the Valencia area alone, this submarket can serve as a window to broader supply and demand dynamics. My overarching goal is to help you navigate **homes for sale in Valencia** or throughout the **Santa Clarita Valley**, with clarity and confidence—no matter which side of the transaction you’re on.

So pull up a chair, grab a cup of coffee (or tea, if you’re like me and trying to cut down on caffeine now that we’re approaching the new year), and let’s dive into the labyrinth of real estate in Santa Clarita, specifically focusing on Valencia. If you’ve heard about the “Valencia buzz” but you’re not 100% sure what all that excitement is about, keep reading—this post is tailor-made for you.

## 2. The Santa Clarita Valley Real Estate Market: A Bird’s-Eye View

Before zeroing in on the microcosm of **Valencia, CA**, it’s essential to take a bird’s-eye look at the entire **Santa Clarita Valley** real estate market. I often tell my clients, friends, and family that Santa Clarita is like an expansive tapestry. You can’t fully appreciate the intricacies of a single patch (Valencia, for example) unless you view the tapestry in its entirety.

**Overall Activity:**

	- **Active Listings**: Across Santa Clarita, we currently see around **458 active listings**—a statistic that indicates a robust market even during what some consider the “off-season.” These active listings span all price points, from roughly $160,000 (you read that right, there’s at least one very low-priced property out there!) all the way to around $5.1 million. As you can imagine, this range covers the entire spectrum of property types: condominiums, townhomes, sprawling single-family estates, and everything in between.

	- **Median List Price**: The **median list price** stands at **$829,900**, which, for many, represents a comfortable sweet spot, especially for those who have built some equity or are moving from another region in California where prices are even higher.

	- **Median Price per Square Foot**: Currently, the Santa Clarita region boasts a **median price per square foot** of **$439.05**. This figure helps buyers quickly compare one home to another of similar square footage, though remember that location, layout, and condition can significantly impact a property’s valuation.

	- **Pending Sales**: A total of **118** properties are under contract, indicating strong buyer interest. The **median days on market** for these properties is about 31 days, showcasing a fairly brisk pace—homes aren’t exactly languishing for months as you might see in a slow market.

**Closed Sales (Last 60 Days)**:

	- Around **47** properties have successfully closed in the last two months.

	- **Average Sale-to-List Price Ratio**: 97.7%—this ratio means sellers are netting close to their asking price. So while there’s a bit of negotiation happening, we’re not in a slump where properties sell for drastically below listing. The median closing price in these deals has been around **$789,178**.

Naturally, interest rates play a role in all of this. Recent changes have caused some buyers to hesitate, hoping that 2025 will usher in lower rates. Some experts predict slight fluctuations but not necessarily a dramatic drop. If you’re in a stable situation financially, it may be worth talking to your lender about locking in a rate or exploring adjustable-rate mortgages with the plan to refinance down the line.

**Seasonality** also matters. December is often considered a slower month in many parts of the country, but Santa Clarita’s mild climate and ongoing economic development can keep the gears turning year-round. If you’re a buyer, you might find less competition from other buyers during the holiday season, which could mean more room for negotiation. On the other hand, sellers who list in December or January often have a strong motivation to sell. In other words, the holiday season can be an advantage to both sides, as long as they know how to leverage the situation.

Finally, keep in mind the population growth and job opportunities in the Santa Clarita Valley. This area has become a major hub for entertainment (given its proximity to major studios), aerospace, technology, healthcare, and more. A healthy job market correlates to sustained demand for homes. People want to live near their workplace, in a city that’s safe, family-friendly, and brimming with recreational opportunities. Santa Clarita—and specifically Valencia—checks all of these boxes.

## 3. Zooming in on Valencia, CA: The Heart of Santa Clarita

If the Santa Clarita Valley is the tapestry, then **Valencia** is undoubtedly one of its shining central panels. This master-planned community, known for its **family-friendly neighborhoods**, **picturesque paseos (walking paths)**, and **top-rated schools**, has emerged as a particularly attractive destination for homeowners and investors.

**Valencia Market Snapshot**

	- **Active Listings**: Typically, around 120 or more active listings can be found in Valencia. Within that pool, you’ll see everything from compact condos ideal for first-time buyers or empty nesters, all the way up to multi-million-dollar luxury estates in gated communities.

	- **Price Range**: In the current environment, active listings span from **about $580,000** to nearly **$5 million**. This enormous range speaks to the diversity of the housing stock. Whether you’re looking for something cozy or you’re on the hunt for a palatial compound, chances are Valencia has you covered.

	- **Median Days on Market**: Right now, the average home in Valencia stays on the market for about **59 days**. Keep in mind that “median days on market” is only one piece of the puzzle. Some homes, especially those in prime condition and priced right, can move in mere weeks, if not days. Others, particularly if they’re overpriced or require updates, might sit much longer.

	- **Popular Price Points**: We’re seeing strong buyer interest in the **$700,000 to $900,000** price range. This bracket is often viewed as the sweet spot for families upgrading from a starter home. Many folks in that price bracket are able to afford more space, but still find the monthly mortgage payment manageable (especially if they’ve locked in a decent interest rate).

### Valencia’s Appeal: Why the Hype?

	- **Master-Planned Perfection**: Valencia’s unique layout features *paseos*—a network of walking paths and bridges that allow residents to travel between neighborhoods, schools, and shopping centers without needing a car. This emphasis on walkability has contributed to a friendly, community-centric atmosphere.

	- **High-Rated Schools**: Part of the renowned **William S. Hart Union High School District** and several esteemed elementary districts, Valencia schools consistently garner positive rankings and reviews. From the perspective of families, this is a major draw—good schools can make or break a neighborhood’s desirability.

	- **Local Amenities**: Valencia is replete with local shopping centers, from the **Westfield Valencia Town Center** to smaller plazas peppered throughout the city. Restaurants, cafes, parks, sports facilities, and entertainment options abound. Because of this, residents rarely feel the need to drive to Los Angeles proper, though LA is only about 30 miles south if they want the “big city” experience.

	- **Business &amp; Jobs**: Large companies have established offices in and around Valencia. Meanwhile, smaller businesses thrive in a locale known for fostering entrepreneurial endeavors. A stable local economy bodes well for property values.

	- **Community Events**: Valencia hosts a variety of seasonal and annual events—festivals, farmers markets, and holiday gatherings that bring neighbors together. This fosters a sense of unity and pride among residents, further amplifying the area’s appeal.

In short, **Valencia** enjoys a near-perfect blend of suburban tranquility and urban convenience. As a result, it’s no wonder homes in this area often attract multiple offers—especially if they’re move-in ready and priced intelligently.

## 4. Mello-Roos and Special Assessments: What You Need to Know

Now, no **Santa Clarita real estate update** would be complete without at least a nod to **Mello-Roos**. If you’re new to **Valencia, CA real estate**, you might be wondering what in the world Mello-Roos is and why it keeps coming up in conversation. Let me paint a picture:

**What Is Mello-Roos?**

Mello-Roos is a special tax district created to finance improvements and services in newly developed areas. The name comes from the legislators who authored the bill—Henry Mello and Mike Roos. In Valencia and some surrounding Santa Clarita neighborhoods, Mello-Roos fees help fund local infrastructure (roads, schools, parks, etc.). Although beneficial, these fees can add significantly to a homeowner’s annual tax bill.

**Pros &amp; Cons**:

	- **Pros**: If you’re living in a Mello-Roos district, you’re likely benefiting from updated infrastructure, well-maintained roads, and excellent schools. Essentially, Mello-Roos ensures developers have the funds for building new communities and amenities without placing too heavy a financial burden on existing communities.

	- **Cons**: The added tax can make monthly and annual ownership costs higher. Buyers should factor Mello-Roos into their budgeting and mortgage qualification. If you forget to do so, you could find yourself stretching further financially than you intended.

**Does Mello-Roos Ever End?**

Here’s the good news: Many Mello-Roos fees have a built-in expiration date—20 to 30 years from the start. That means if you buy a home in a district whose Mello-Roos is set to expire soon, you may see your tax burden drop in the coming years. However, it’s crucial to confirm actual expiration dates. Some communities vote to extend or re-institute Mello-Roos to fund additional projects.

**Important Tip** for sellers: If your home’s Mello-Roos obligations are nearing expiration, **showcase that** in your listings or during showings. Buyers sometimes shy away from properties with Mello-Roos, so letting them know that relief is on the horizon can ease concerns. Conversely, if you have a brand-new Mello-Roos bond that isn’t expiring for two or three decades, be transparent. Buyers want clarity, and honesty fosters trust.

**Tax Deductions?**

A recurring question I get: “Can I deduct Mello-Roos on my taxes?” The answer usually depends on how the tax is classified and if it funds general services or specific improvements. I’m not a CPA, so I always advise consulting a tax professional. If you’re paying it, it’s definitely worth investigating whether you can offset some or all of that cost in your annual returns.

For **Valencia, CA real estate** in particular, keep an eye on Mello-Roos disclosures in any listing. Not all Valencia neighborhoods have Mello-Roos, but many of the newer developments do. As a buyer, don’t be shy: **ask** your agent, the listing agent, the homeowner, or the HOA for specifics. The more you know, the easier it is to make a sound decision.

## 5. Tips for Sellers: Maximizing Your Home’s Value in Valencia

Selling a home can be an emotional roller coaster. Many of us accumulate years—if not decades—of memories in the place we call home, making it hard to view our property objectively. Below are some steps that can significantly boost your home’s appeal (and hopefully its final sale price) without requiring an all-out remodel.

### 5.1 Declutter and Depersonalize

This is *the* golden rule of prepping any home for sale. As I jokingly mentioned, many first responders or career professionals have entire “war rooms” dedicated to memorabilia. To you, that might be the highlight of the home—a symbol of pride and identity. But from a buyer’s perspective, it can be a distraction. Buyers want to envision themselves in the space, free of existing personal stamps. So, remove personal photos, trophies, or large displays that might not appeal to everyone. Instead, present rooms in a neutral manner that highlights each space’s potential.

### 5.2 Curb Appeal

It might sound cliché, but first impressions matter. Mow the lawn, trim the hedges, power-wash the driveway, and, if possible, give that front door a fresh coat of paint. These small details hint at broader home care standards. If the exterior looks immaculate, buyers will step inside with a positive, open mindset.

### 5.3 Neutral Color Palette

If you have a neon accent wall or a living room that’s a bold shade of purple, consider neutralizing it. Colors like light gray, beige, or off-white are less polarizing and allow prospective buyers to project their own style onto the home.

### 5.4 Address Repairs

Leaky faucets, cracked windows, or faulty electrical outlets can easily plant doubt in a buyer’s mind. If you’re dealing with nagging minor issues, fix them before listing. Larger issues—such as roof repairs or structural concerns—require cost-benefit analysis. Sometimes, it’s best to fix them and highlight the improvement in the listing. Other times, you might price the property accordingly and disclose the issue upfront.

### 5.5 Highlight Upgrades with Paperwork

Did you replace the HVAC or water heater recently? Or install new windows, upgrade the plumbing, or switch to energy-efficient appliances? If yes, keep those receipts and highlight them. Buyers, especially in Valencia, are often willing to pay more if they know big-ticket items have been handled. Emphasizing these upgrades could be the difference between two or three offers and a bidding war.

### 5.6 Market Based on Location Perks

Valencia is known for its scenic paseos, top-tier schools, and proximity to shopping centers like the Westfield Valencia Town Center. Let your prospective buyers know how convenient it is to walk to the grocery store, how close the local elementary school is, or how quick the commute can be to the nearest freeway. People moving from outside Santa Clarita might not realize these benefits.

## 6. Tips for Buyers: Securing Your Dream Home in Valencia

On the flip side, if you’re on the prowl for **Valencia, CA real estate**, here’s how you can set yourself up for success:

### 6.1 Re-Visit Your Lender (If You Were Already Pre-Qualified)

If you’ve been pre-qualified in 2024 and have been “waiting for the market to change,” you might not need to do the entire pre-qualification process over again. A quick check-in with your lender to update your financials (pay stubs, bank statements, etc.) is often enough. This could put you back in the game for those prime Valencia listings.

### 6.2 Shop Interest Rates

Interest rates are a moving target. Chat with multiple lenders to see if you can secure a better rate or loan program. A fraction of a percentage point can save you thousands over the life of a loan. If rates happen to dip in 2025, you may also consider refinancing later.

### 6.3 Pay Attention to Mello-Roos

As detailed earlier, some Valencia neighborhoods carry Mello-Roos, and some do not. For those that do, confirm the tax rate, expiration date, and if there are any possible extensions. It might be possible that your prospective home has an end date looming—great news for your long-term savings. Alternatively, it might be a brand-new bond with multiple decades ahead. Either scenario can be okay, but you’ll want to weigh the pros and cons regarding your monthly outlay.

### 6.4 Calculate Your Max Budget with Extras

Don’t forget property taxes, HOA fees (if applicable), homeowner’s insurance, and potential Mello-Roos. If you push your purchase to the limit of your pre-approval without factoring in these added costs, you could find yourself house-poor. Resist the temptation to look only at your monthly mortgage payment.

### 6.5 Home Inspections Are Not Optional

Always, always, always get a home inspection. A certified home inspector can reveal hidden issues—plumbing leaks, foundational cracks, or outdated wiring. While an inspection might set you back a few hundred dollars, it’s worth its weight in gold for the peace of mind it provides. If a major issue surfaces, you can negotiate repairs or price reductions with the seller.

### 6.6 Timing and Negotiation

Yes, we’re seeing a median of 59 days on market for Valencia properties, but that doesn’t mean you should necessarily wait around. If you love a home, act swiftly but do so smartly. If the home has been on the market for 90+ days, there could be more room for negotiation. If it’s a fresh listing that checks all the boxes and is fairly priced, you might face competition. Strategy is key!

## 7. Building Your Santa Clarita Real Estate Knowledge: The Connor with Honor Brand &amp; Book

If you’ve found this information useful, you’re not alone. One reason I create these **Santa Clarita real estate updates** is to empower local homeowners and prospective buyers to make educated decisions. Having worn different hats—first responder, community advocate, and local real estate professional—I believe in providing real-time data, transparency, and a steady hand as you navigate the complexities of real estate in **Valencia, CA** or anywhere else in Santa Clarita.

### 7.1 Why the “Connor with Honor” Approach Works

	- **Experience**: I’ve been in the real estate game for a while, and I’ve seen markets at their hottest and at their coolest. That experience translates to an ability to anticipate trends and guide you with caution and optimism.

	- **Community Roots**: I understand the local flavor: the schools, the events, the commute patterns, the hidden gems. This insider knowledge can save you time and money.

	- **Trust &amp; Transparency**: The same honesty I advocated for sellers and buyers is central to how I operate. Real estate is more than transactions; it’s about building relationships that last long after escrow closes.

### 7.2 The Santa Clarita Edition: How to Buy and Sell Real Estate

I’ve recently updated my **book** for 2025, titled something along the lines of *“How to Buy and Sell Real Estate: Santa Clarita Edition.”* In it, you’ll find step-by-step guides on everything from picking the right mortgage product to staging your home for maximum impact. I cover legal forms, highlight local vendors for inspections and repairs, and delve even further into nuanced topics like Mello-Roos, HOAs, and probate sales. If you found **this** blog post helpful, the book will be your comprehensive companion—packed with checklists, real-life anecdotes, and cautionary tales to help you avoid common pitfalls.

## 8. Conclusion: Next Steps and Final Thoughts on Valencia, CA Real Estate

We’ve journeyed through the **Santa Clarita real estate** landscape, narrowing our focus on **Valencia**, one of the region’s most dynamic and desirable neighborhoods. We’ve dissected active listings, closed sales, days on market, and overarching trends like the importance of good curb appeal, the role of Mello-Roos, and the power of interest rates in shaping your monthly payment.

Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, **Valencia** isn’t just another Los Angeles suburb. It’s a thriving community with top-tier amenities, parks, schools, and a strong sense of local pride. Property values here have shown resilience even when other markets dipped, largely thanks to the area’s robust infrastructure and consistent demand from people looking for a balanced life near job centers yet away from big-city congestion.

As of **December 23, 2024**, we see:

	- **458 active listings** in Santa Clarita (a significant portion of which are in Valencia).

	- A **median listing price** of **$829,900**, with a **median price per square foot** at **$439.05**.

If you’re a **buyer**, do yourself a favor and get or update your pre-approval now. Don’t let a wave of new-year competition catch you off guard. If you’re a **seller**, present your home in its best light and price it realistically. The data shows buyers still have options; overpricing a home to “test” the market can backfire, pushing you into more days on market than necessary.
