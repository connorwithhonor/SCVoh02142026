#### Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Update - July 15th, 2024

![](https://idx-acnt-ihouseprd.b-cdn.net/AR1197716/file_manager/Santa%20Clarita%20Open%20houses%20buyers%20real%20estate%20market.png?width=500&amp;height=281&amp;aspect_ratio=500%3A281)Hey Santa Clarita! It's July 15th, 2024. I'm Connor with Honor, and here’s your daily real estate update.

Before we dive into the numbers, a quick reminder: if you know a real estate agent, remind them to always stay professional in their communications. Keeping emails and messages respectful and above reproach is crucial. Now, let's get into the market stats:

**Market Watch:**

	- Coming Soon: 17

	- New Listings: 90

	- Price Changes: 69

	- Back On Market: 18

	- Active Under Contract: 31

	- Pending: 50

	- Closed: 50

	- Expired: 3

	- Canceled: 12

	- Hold: 9

	- Withdrawn: 4

We currently have 466 total active listings on the market. This week alone, we’ve seen a significant influx of 90 new properties. This is a notable increase and something to keep an eye on.

Price changes continue to be a trend, with 69 properties adjusting their prices. The market is dynamic, and we’re seeing more properties back on the market, totaling 18 this week.

In terms of activity, 31 properties are active under contract, 50 are pending, and 50 have closed escrow this week. The market is moving quickly, but we are starting to see a slight increase in the time it takes for properties to sell. While the data is still fresh, we’re noticing it takes about 3 to 10 more days for properties to move from active to escrow. This can vary by city and price point, but it’s an emerging trend.

As more inventory comes on the market, we might see changes in the dynamics of the Santa Clarita real estate market. Currently, sellers are still receiving multiple offers if their properties are priced correctly, and buyers are facing high competition.

Stay tuned as we keep you updated on these trends. For a deeper dive into how the Santa Clarita real estate market can shift from a seller’s to a buyer’s market, check out our latest podcast episode and YouTube video:

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
