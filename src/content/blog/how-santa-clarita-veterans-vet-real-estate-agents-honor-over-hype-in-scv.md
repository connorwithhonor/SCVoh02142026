## **TL;DR**

Not all real estate agents are created equal. Connor MacIvor—25-year Santa Clarita real estate veteran and 20-year LAPD officer—uses law enforcement-grade vetting to identify agents with proven integrity, local expertise, and client advocacy. Learn the exact criteria that separate honorable professionals from hype-driven salespeople, and why veteran-vetted referrals outperform algorithm-based matching every time.

## **The Problem: Real Estate Marketing vs. Real Estate Competence**

Walk into any coffee shop in Valencia, scroll through Facebook, or drive down Bouquet Canyon Road, and you'll see real estate agent advertising everywhere.

**"#1 Agent in Santa Clarita!"**

**"Award-Winning Service!"**

**"Sold 100+ Homes This Year!"**

Here's what those claims don't tell you:

**Marketing hype is cheap. Integrity is earned.**

After 25 years in Santa Clarita real estate and 20 years with LAPD, I've developed a vetting process that goes beyond billboards and Instagram posts. I assess agents the same way I assessed people on patrol: **under pressure, with accountability, and based on actions—not words.**

This article breaks down exactly how I vet real estate agents in Santa Clarita Valley, what red flags I look for, and why this process protects you from expensive mistakes.

## **The Five Pillars of Veteran-Level Agent Vetting**

When I evaluate whether an agent belongs in my referral network, I assess them across five critical areas. These aren't arbitrary—they're based on decades of watching agents succeed, fail, and everything in between.

### **Pillar 1: Proven Track Record in Santa Clarita Valley**

**What I'm looking for:**

An agent who has **consistently closed deals in SCV** for at least 3-5 years, preferably longer.

**Why this matters:**

New agents aren't necessarily bad, but they're learning on your dime. They haven't navigated multiple market cycles. They don't have relationships with local inspectors, appraisers, lenders, and escrow officers. They haven't dealt with the quirks of Santa Clarita HOAs, school district boundaries, or commute patterns.

**Red flags:**

**What I verify:**

**Example:**

I referred a buyer to an agent who had sold 40+ homes in Valencia Woodlands over the past five years. When the buyer found a home they loved, the agent knew the builder, the HOA rules, and even which units had better views based on tree growth patterns. That's **local expertise** you can't fake.

### **Pillar 2: Integrity Under Pressure**

**What I'm looking for:**

An agent who does the right thing **even when it costs them money or time.**

**Why this matters:**

Real estate deals get messy. Inspections reveal problems. Buyers get cold feet. Sellers get emotional. Appraisals come in low. Financing falls through.

**The question is: Does your agent protect YOU, or do they protect the DEAL?**

A bad agent will:

A good agent will:

**How I assess this:**

I ask other agents, lenders, and escrow officers about their experiences. I look for patterns:

**Red flags:**

**Example:**

I know an agent who advised her seller to accept a lower offer from a pre-approved buyer instead of a higher offer from a buyer with shaky financing. The seller was furious—until the shaky buyer's financing fell through three weeks later, and the deal would have collapsed. The agent sacrificed her short-term commission to protect her client's long-term outcome.

**That's integrity.**

Learn more about why integrity matters in Santa Clarita real estate.

### **Pillar 3: Responsive Communication**

**What I'm looking for:**

An agent who responds to calls, texts, and emails **quickly and consistently**, even when they're busy.

**Why this matters:**

Real estate moves fast. A hot listing in Stevenson Ranch might have 10 offers in 48 hours. A buyer's financing approval might expire in days. An inspection issue might require immediate negotiation.

**If your agent doesn't respond, you lose.**

**What "responsive" actually means:**

**Red flags:**

**How I assess this:**

I text or call agents in my network at random times. Do they respond? How long does it take? Are they courteous even when I'm interrupting their day?

I also ask their past clients: "How was communication? Did you feel informed throughout the process?"

**Example:**

One agent in my network uses [Honor Elevate's AI voice system](https://www.honorelevate.com/) to answer calls 24/7. If you call at 9 PM on Saturday because you just saw a house you love, the AI answers immediately, gathers your info, and books a showing for Sunday morning. The agent follows up personally within an hour.

**That's the kind of responsiveness modern clients expect.**

### **Pillar 4: Negotiation Skills (Not Just "Closing" Skills)**

**What I'm looking for:**

An agent who **negotiates aggressively on your behalf**, not just someone who closes deals.

**Why this matters:**

There's a massive difference between "closing a deal" and "negotiating the best possible outcome for the client."

**A mediocre agent will:**

**A great agent will:**

**How I assess this:**

I ask: "Tell me about a deal where you walked away or fought for your client even though it was uncomfortable."

If they can't give me a specific example, that's a red flag.

**Red flags:**

**Example:**

A buyer I referred wanted a home in Canyon Country. The listing agent claimed there were multiple offers and pressured them to go $50K over asking with no contingencies.

The agent I referred did comps, verified there weren't actually multiple offers, and advised the buyer to offer $10K over asking with standard contingencies. The seller accepted.

**That saved the buyer $40K and protected them from waiving critical protections.**

Learn more about negotiation strategies in competitive SCV markets.

### **Pillar 5: Long-Term Relationship Mindset**

**What I'm looking for:**

An agent who sees you as a **long-term relationship**, not a one-time transaction.

**Why this matters:**

Agents who focus on volume treat you like a number. Agents who focus on relationships treat you like a person.

**What this looks like in practice:**

**Red flags:**

**How I assess this:**

I ask: "Do you stay in touch with past clients? How?"

I also check their Google/Yelp reviews for patterns. Do clients mention long-term relationships, or do they say "great during the transaction, never heard from them again"?

**Example:**

One agent in my network sends a personalized annual home value update to every past client, along with a handwritten note on their home purchase anniversary. It's a small gesture, but it shows they care beyond the commission check.

**That's the kind of agent who builds a career on referrals, not paid leads.**

## **Why LAPD Training Makes Me Better at Vetting Agents**

People often ask: "Connor, what does being a cop have to do with real estate?"

**Everything.**

### **Assessing Truthfulness**

In law enforcement, you learn to assess whether someone is being straight with you or hiding something. You read body language, tone, word choice, and consistency.

**Same skills apply to vetting agents:**

### **Evaluating Performance Under Pressure**

Cops are constantly evaluated under pressure. How do you handle a chaotic scene? Do you stay calm or panic? Do you follow protocol or improvise recklessly?

**Same questions for agents:**

### **Character Assessment**

Twenty years of law enforcement taught me that **character reveals itself under stress.**

**Those are the people I want in my referral network.**

Learn more about how law enforcement experience shapes real estate vetting.

## **Red Flags That Disqualify Agents From My Referral Network**

Not every agent makes the cut. Here are the automatic disqualifiers:

### **1. Dishonesty (Even "Small" Lies)**

If I catch an agent lying about anything—sales volume, awards, transaction details—they're out. Period.

**Why?** If they'll lie about small things, they'll lie about big things.

### **2. Pressure Tactics**

Agents who pressure clients to waive contingencies, accept bad deals, or make rushed decisions don't belong in my network.

**Why?** I'm not referring you to someone who manipulates you into decisions that benefit them, not you.

### **3. Poor Communication**

If an agent ghosts me, takes days to respond, or doesn't keep me updated, they're out.

**Why?** If they treat me (a referral source) poorly, they'll treat you (the client) worse.

### **4. Reputation Problems**

If other agents, lenders, or escrow officers warn me about someone, I dig deeper. If the warnings are valid, that agent doesn't get my referrals.

**Why?** Where there's smoke, there's fire. I'm not risking your transaction on someone with a sketchy reputation.

### **5. Volume Over Quality**

Agents who brag about closing 200+ deals a year are usually spread too thin. You become one of 200, not one of 20.

**Why?** I'd rather refer you to an agent who closes 30 deals with white-glove service than 200 deals with rushed, impersonal treatment.

## **How This Vetting Process Protects You**

When you get a referral from me, you're not just getting "an agent." You're getting an agent who has been:

✅ **Verified for local expertise** (they know SCV inside and out)

✅ **Tested for integrity** (they do the right thing under pressure)

✅ **Confirmed for responsiveness** (they communicate quickly and clearly)

✅ **Proven in negotiation** (they fight for you, not just close deals)

✅ **Committed to relationships** (you're not a transaction, you're a person)

**Translation:** You're working with a professional I'd trust with my own family's real estate needs.

Compare that to a Zillow referral, where the agent paid $75 for your contact info and you're one of five leads they're chasing that day.

**Which sounds better?**

## **Case Study: How Vetting Saved a Client $60,000**

Let me give you a real-world example of why this vetting process matters.

### **The Situation**

A couple contacted me looking to buy in Stevenson Ranch. They'd been working with an agent they found on Realtor.com, but something felt off. The agent was pushy, didn't listen to their needs, and kept showing them homes outside their price range.

### **The Problem**

They found a home they loved, listed at $950,000. The agent told them: "This is hot, you need to offer $1,020,000 with no inspection contingency or you'll lose it."

**Red flags everywhere:**

### **The Intervention**

They called me before submitting the offer. I connected them with an agent from my network who:

### **The Outcome**

They offered $970K with full inspection and financing contingencies. The seller accepted.

**Result:** They saved $50K on purchase price, kept their protections, and discovered during inspection that the HVAC needed $10K in repairs (which the seller credited).

**Total savings: ~$60,000.**

**All because they worked with a vetted agent instead of a random Realtor.com match.**

## **Why Santa Clarita Is Different From Los Angeles Real Estate**

I spent 20 years as an LAPD officer in Los Angeles and 25 years selling real estate in Santa Clarita Valley. Here's what most people don't realize: **SCV is NOT LA.**

### **Different Buyer Priorities**

**Los Angeles buyers care about:**

**Santa Clarita buyers care about:**

**If your agent doesn't understand these differences, they'll waste your time.**

### **Different Market Dynamics**

**Los Angeles:**

**Santa Clarita:**

**An agent who works primarily in LA won't understand SCV pricing, negotiation, or buyer psychology.**

### **Different Community Dynamics**

Santa Clarita is a smaller, tighter-knit community. **Reputations matter here.**

In LA, an agent can burn bridges and move to a different neighborhood. In SCV, word gets around fast. If an agent screws over a client, the whole valley hears about it.

**That's why the agents in my network protect their reputations fiercely—they live and work here.**

## **The Honor Elevate Advantage: Why Tech-Forward Agents Serve You Better**

Many of the agents in my referral network use [Honor Elevate](https://www.honorelevate.com/), my AI automation platform for real estate professionals.

**Here's why that matters to you:**

### **1. Faster Response Times**

AI voice systems answer calls 24/7. If you call at 10 PM because you found your dream home online, you get an immediate response—not a voicemail.

### **2. Better Organization**

All client communication is tracked in one CRM. Your agent never forgets a detail, misses a follow-up, or loses track of important dates.

### **3. Consistent Updates**

Automated systems send you transaction updates at key milestones. You're never left wondering "what's happening with my deal?"

### **4. More Time for You**

When agents automate repetitive tasks (scheduling, follow-ups, social media), they have more time for high-value activities like negotiation, strategy, and client communication.

**Translation:** Honor Elevate doesn't replace the human relationship—it enhances it.

## **Common Questions About Agent Vetting**

### **"How do you handle agents who don't make the cut?"**

I don't publicly criticize them. I just don't refer them.

If someone asks why I didn't refer a specific agent, I'm honest: "They didn't meet my standards for integrity/responsiveness/local expertise."

### **"Do you re-evaluate agents over time?"**

Yes. Markets change. Agents evolve. Someone who was great five years ago might be coasting now. Someone who was inexperienced three years ago might have developed into a top performer.

I stay in touch with the market, ask for feedback from clients I've referred, and adjust my network accordingly.

### **"What if I already have an agent but I'm not happy?"**

You're not locked in. If you haven't signed a buyer representation agreement or listing agreement, you can switch agents.

If you have signed something, read the contract carefully. Most have termination clauses.

**Either way, contact me and we'll figure out your options.**

### **"Do you refer agents outside Santa Clarita?"**

Yes. I spent 20 years with LAPD in Los Angeles, so I know trusted agents throughout LA County.

If you're buying/selling in Burbank, Pasadena, Glendale, Northridge, or anywhere in the San Fernando Valley, I can connect you with vetted professionals.

### **"How much does a referral cost?"**

Nothing. You pay the same commission whether you work with an agent I refer or an agent you find on Zillow.

The difference? **The agent I refer has been vetted for integrity and competence.**

## **The Difference Between "Good" and "Great" Agents**

Most agents are competent. They know how to write contracts, show homes, and close deals.

**But competent isn't enough.**

### **Good Agents:**

### **Great Agents:**

**I only refer great agents.**

## **Why Referrals Beat Online Reviews**

People often ask: "Why can't I just read Google reviews and pick an agent?"

**You can. But here's what online reviews don't tell you:**

### **Reviews Can Be Gamed**

### **Reviews Don't Reveal Weaknesses**

A review might say "Great agent!" but won't tell you:

### **Reviews Don't Account for Fit**

An agent who's perfect for first-time buyers might be wrong for luxury sellers. An agent who dominates Valencia might struggle in Castaic.

**My referrals are personalized based on YOUR situation.**

## **Summary: Honor Over Hype in Santa Clarita Real Estate**

Marketing is easy. Integrity is hard.

After 25 years in Santa Clarita real estate and 20 years with LAPD, I've built a referral network based on one principle: **I only recommend agents I'd trust with my own family.**

That means: ✅ Proven local expertise

✅ Integrity under pressure

✅ Responsive communication

✅ Aggressive negotiation

✅ Long-term relationship mindset

**No hype. No algorithms. Just personal introductions backed by decades of experience and a reputation I protect fiercely.**

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
