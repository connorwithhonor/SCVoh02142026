### **A Word of Caution: Choosing the Right Real Estate Representation**

In a recent video, I discussed the importance of&nbsp;**"eyes wide open"**&nbsp;decision-making when navigating real estate. This is especially true when selecting your agent or lender. If someone offers to double as both your real estate agent and lender, it’s critical to thoroughly vet their qualifications and ensure their dual role aligns with your best interests.

**Key Takeaways for Buyers:**

	- Always verify claims in writing.

	- Read all contracts carefully, particularly buyer representation agreements.

	- When in doubt, seek a second opinion from a trusted advisor.

**Key Takeaways for Sellers:**

	- Work with an agent who has a deep understanding of local market dynamics.

	- Ensure your property’s unique features are adequately marketed.

### **Legislation Update: AB2992**

Starting January 1, 2025,&nbsp;**Assembly Bill 2992**&nbsp;will mandate buyer representation agreements in California. This change means buyers must formally agree to work with a specific agent for a defined period. Key components include:

	- **Timeframe**: Most agreements will last up to 90 days.

	- **Property Scope**: The agreement will specify the types of properties covered.

	- **Compensation**: It’s essential to understand how your agent is compensated—whether by the seller or directly by you 【25†source】.

Buyers and sell​&nbsp;themselves with these agreements and clarify any terms before signing.
