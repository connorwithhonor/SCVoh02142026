# **Santa Clarita Real Estate Sales Dropped 43% – What This Means for Buyers &amp; Sellers in 2025**

**The real estate market in Santa Clarita saw a 43% drop in sales from December 2024 to January 2025.** But does this signal a shift in the market, or is it just part of the typical seasonal trend?

With **473 active listings** now on the market and **112 homes closing escrow in January**, compared to nearly **200 homes sold in December**, there’s no doubt that **activity has slowed down**—but this shift presents **unique opportunities for buyers and sellers** alike.

### **Why Did Santa Clarita Real Estate Sales Drop 43%?**

Several key factors contributed to the decrease in closed sales:

### **Is This a Buyer’s or Seller’s Market in Santa Clarita?**

The increased inventory and lower sales volume indicate a **transitioning market**—but which side benefits most?

#### **For Buyers: This Is Your Window of Opportunity**

Santa Clarita **homebuyers have more leverage than they did in 2024**, making this **an excellent time to negotiate**.

**What Buyers Should Do Right Now**

#### **For Sellers: Proper Pricing &amp; Strategy Are Key**

If you’re selling a home in **Santa Clarita**, the **increase in inventory means more competition**. However, **proper pricing and market preparation** can still get you **top dollar**.

**What Sellers Should Do Right Now**

Don’t rely on **AI-based estimates**—instead, get a **data-driven, expert market report** for your neighborhood:

### **The #1 Tip for Buyers in Santa Clarita – Why Full Loan Approval is a Game Changer in 2025**

The Santa Clarita real estate market is shifting, with **473 active listings and sales down 43% from December to January**. While this presents more opportunities for buyers, it also means that **sellers are becoming more selective**. The strongest buyers in today’s market are those who come prepared—not just with a pre-approval but with **a fully underwritten loan approval**.

Many buyers assume that getting pre-approved is enough, but in a competitive market, that’s simply not the case. A **fully underwritten approval** gives buyers a significant edge, making their offers stand out to sellers.

## **What is Full Loan Approval, and How is It Different from Pre-Approval?**

There’s a major difference between **pre-qualification, pre-approval, and full loan approval**.

Sellers are more likely to accept offers from **fully approved buyers** because there’s less risk of the deal falling through due to financing issues.

## **Why Full Loan Approval Matters in Santa Clarita’s Market**

As inventory grows and buyers become more selective, sellers want **certainty**. A buyer with full loan approval is more attractive than one with a simple pre-approval.

### **Here’s why full approval gives you an advantage:**

### **1. Sellers Take Your Offer More Seriously**

When competing against other buyers, a fully underwritten approval **eliminates doubt** in a seller’s mind. Sellers want to avoid deals falling through due to **loan denials, delays, or financing issues**. A buyer with **full approval is as close to a cash buyer as possible.**

### **2. You Can Negotiate Better Terms**

Buyers with full loan approval often have **more leverage in negotiations**. Since your financing is already secure, sellers may be **more willing to accept a lower offer, cover closing costs, or provide other concessions.**

### **3. You Close Faster**

Typical home purchases take **30-45 days to close** due to financing and underwriting delays. A fully underwritten approval can **cut this timeline in half**, making your offer even more attractive.

### **4. You Avoid Last-Minute Surprises**

Many buyers **don’t realize they could be denied a mortgage** even after receiving pre-approval. If new debts appear on your credit report, income verification changes, or financial issues arise, your loan can be rejected. With full underwriting approval, those risks are eliminated upfront.

If you haven’t started this process, **begin your loan approval today:** Get Pre-Approved.

## **How to Get Full Loan Approval Before House Hunting**

### **Step 1: Choose a Lender Who Offers Full Underwriting Before You Make an Offer**

Not all lenders will underwrite a loan before a buyer finds a home. Work with a lender who is **willing to process your entire file upfront**, so your offer is stronger.

### **Step 2: Submit All Required Documents**

For full approval, be prepared to provide:

### **Step 3: Maintain Your Financial Profile**

Once you receive full approval, **don’t make any financial changes** that could impact your mortgage qualification. Avoid:

A lender will do a **final verification before closing**, so keeping your financial status stable is essential.

## **Why You Should Avoid Dual Agency When Buying a Home**

Many buyers assume that **using the seller’s agent** will make the process easier or help them get a better deal. In reality, this can be a **major disadvantage**.

### **What is Dual Agency?**

Dual agency happens when **the same agent represents both the buyer and the seller** in a transaction. Some states have outlawed this practice because it creates an **inherent conflict of interest**.

### **Why is Dual Agency Risky for Buyers?**

Make sure you’re protected in your home purchase. Learn more here: **Buyer’s Guide.**

## **How Buyers Can Leverage the Changing Market in 2025**

The 43% drop in real estate sales means **sellers are more open to negotiation**. Buyers who **secure full loan approval and avoid dual agency pitfalls** will have the best chance at **getting a great deal** in the months ahead.

### **What You Should Do Now**

## **Final Thoughts: The Best Buyers Come Prepared**

In Santa Clarita’s 2025 real estate market, **the buyers who succeed will be the ones who take proactive steps**. A fully underwritten loan approval is the **most powerful tool you can have** when competing for homes.

If you’re serious about buying a home, don’t wait until you find the perfect property—**get fully approved now and position yourself ahead of the competition.**

# **What Sellers Must Know in 2025 – AI Home Valuations vs. Real Market Data in Santa Clarita**

In today’s digital age, many **home sellers in Santa Clarita** turn to online real estate platforms to get an estimate of their home’s value. Websites claim to provide **instant valuations**, promising sellers a quick and easy way to determine their asking price.

But there’s a problem—**these AI-generated home values are often inaccurate**, leading to **overpriced or underpriced listings** that can cost sellers thousands of dollars.

The Santa Clarita real estate market is shifting. With **473 active listings** and a **43% decrease in sales from December to January**, pricing your home **correctly** is more important than ever. Let’s break down **why AI home valuations can mislead sellers** and **how to get an accurate, data-driven home valuation** before putting your property on the market.

## **The Problem with AI Home Valuations**

### **1. AI Estimates Are Based on Old, Incomplete Data**

Most online home valuation tools use **algorithms that pull from public records and past sales data** to estimate home values. But the problem is:

For an accurate valuation, sellers need **MLS-backed data**—not an outdated estimate from a syndication website.

**Get a professional market analysis backed by real MLS data here:** [Free Market Analysis](/contact).

### **2. AI Can’t Evaluate Home Upgrades or Condition**

Every home is unique. Two homes on the same street might have **very different values** based on:

AI models **don’t walk through your home**—they can’t see **recent upgrades, remodeling, or unique features** that add value.

This is why **human expertise** is essential. A **local real estate professional** can assess what adds value to **your specific home**, something AI simply can’t do.

### **3. AI-Generated Home Values Are Designed to Generate Leads, Not Accuracy**

Many homeowners don’t realize that AI home valuation sites are **lead-generation tools**, not actual pricing models.

When homes are priced incorrectly, they sit on the market **longer than necessary**. Buyers and agents **avoid listings that appear overpriced**, forcing sellers to **cut their price later**—which **could have been avoided with a proper MLS-backed valuation** from the start.

## **How AI-Driven Home Valuations Impact Santa Clarita Sellers**

Let’s look at what happens when a **Santa Clarita home seller** relies on AI rather than a professional market analysis.

### **Overpricing: The Risk of Setting an Unrealistic Listing Price**

Many sellers believe their home is worth **what an AI valuation tool says**—but in reality, **overpricing leads to major consequences**:

Homes priced **right from the start** sell **faster and for more money**.

### **Underpricing: Leaving Money on the Table**

Some AI models **undervalue** homes because they:

This leads to **sellers unknowingly underpricing their homes**, potentially leaving **tens of thousands of dollars on the table**.

The best way to ensure you’re **not selling too low** is by using a **local market report** and a **professional valuation from a Santa Clarita real estate expert**.

## **The Truth About Instant Offer Companies &amp; AI-Driven Home Buyers**

Some companies offer **"instant cash offers"** on homes, claiming to simplify the selling process. While this sounds convenient, **there’s always a catch**.

### **How Instant Offer Companies Profit Off Sellers**

Sellers should always compare **real market data vs. instant offers** before making a decision.

## **How to Get a True Market-Driven Home Valuation in Santa Clarita**

### **Step 1: Use a Professional MLS-Based Valuation**
