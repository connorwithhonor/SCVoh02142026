The Valencia real estate market kicked off 2026 in a surprisingly balanced position. With **270 active listings** and homes taking an average of **53 days to sell**, we're seeing a market that's neither overheated nor stagnant—it's what I call "professionally competitive."

As your **First Responder Realtor in Santa Clarita**, I've analyzed the 2-year trend data to show you exactly what's happening and what it means for sellers right now.

## Valencia Market Snapshot: January 2026

- **Active Listings:** 270 homes
- **Average Days to Sell:** 53 days
- **Market Type:** Balanced to slight seller advantage
- **Trend:** Inventory down from peak, days-to-sell stabilizing

## The 2-Year Valencia Trend (2024-2026)

Looking at the data from January 2024 to January 2026, here's what stands out:

### Inventory Rollercoaster

Valencia's inventory hit some extremes over the past two years:

- **January 2024:** 184 active listings (low inventory, seller's market)
- **Peak (June 2025):** 414 active listings (buyer's market territory)
- **January 2026:** 270 active listings (balanced market)

That's a **47% increase** from January 2024 to January 2026, but it's actually **35% down** from the mid-2025 peak. What does this tell us? The market absorbed the excess inventory, and we've settled into equilibrium.

### Days to Sell: The Real Story

Here's where it gets interesting for sellers:

- **January 2024:** 31 days to sell (fast-moving market)
- **Slowest Period (Feb 2025):** 73 days to sell (buyer leverage)
- **January 2026:** 53 days to sell (normal market pace)

We're seeing **71% longer market times** compared to January 2024, but that's actually *good news* for sellers because:

1. **Quality trumps speed** - Homes that are well-prepared and priced correctly are still moving
2. **Less panic pricing** - Sellers have time to market properly instead of racing to the bottom
3. **Serious buyers only** - With 53 days on market, tire-kickers have moved on

## What This Means for Valencia Home Sellers in 2026

### 1. Pricing Strategy is Critical

In January 2024, you could overprice by 5-10% and still get offers within a month. Not anymore.

With 270 homes to choose from and buyers taking 53 days to decide, **your home needs to be priced within 2-3% of market value** from day one. Overpricing means you'll sit while properly-priced homes sell around you.

**My approach:** I use live MLS data (not Zillow estimates) and mandatory buyer feedback from every showing to position your home competitively from the start.

### 2. Condition Matters More Than Ever

When inventory was at 184 homes, buyers had to compromise. Now? They can be picky.

Homes that check all the boxes are selling in **30-40 days**. Homes with deferred maintenance or outdated features are sitting **70+ days** and eventually dropping price.

**Action item:** Small investments in staging, paint, and curb appeal return 200-500% when it comes to final sale price.

### 3. Marketing Can't Be Generic

With 270 competing listings, your home needs to stand out. Here's what works in 2026:

- **Professional photography** (not iPhone photos)
- **Mandatory open house visitor sign-ins** - I know who walked through and can follow up aggressively
- **Detailed buyer feedback** - When 3 buyers say "kitchen is dated," we know exactly what to address
- **AI-optimized listings** - Your listing needs to rank on ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google SGE searches

*Learn more about my [accountability-based approach](/about) that includes mandatory sign-ins and professional feedback.*

## Valencia vs. Other SCV Cities: How Do We Compare?

Valencia's 53 days to sell is competitive compared to other Santa Clarita Valley neighborhoods:

- **Canyon Country:** 68 days to sell (slower, 225 active listings)
- **Stevenson Ranch:** 68 days to sell (slower, 60 active listings)
- **Newhall:** 75 days to sell (slower, 83 active listings)

**Why is Valencia moving faster?** Schools, master-planned communities, and proximity to major employers (Six Flags, Princess Cruises, Boston Scientific) make Valencia consistently desirable.

## The Opportunity for Valencia Sellers Right Now

If you've been waiting for the "perfect time" to sell your Valencia home, **this is it**:

1. **Inventory is manageable** - 270 homes isn't overwhelming, but it's enough to give buyers options (which keeps them engaged)
2. **Days to sell is predictable** - 53 days means you can plan your next move with confidence
3. **Serious buyers are active** - Tire-kickers left when rates went up; current buyers are qualified and motivated

## What Makes My Approach Different

As a **25-year first responder turned full-time Realtor**, I treat every listing with the same discipline I brought to emergency response:

### Mandatory Accountability

- **100% visitor sign-in at open houses** - No anonymous walk-throughs. I know who viewed your home and can follow up.
- **Written feedback within 24 hours** - After every showing, I get buyer feedback so you know exactly why offers did or didn't come in.
- **No dual agency ever** - I represent YOU exclusively. I never represent both buyer and seller, which would create conflicts of interest.

*Read about [why exclusive representation matters](/blog/from-advocate-to-adversary-when-the-selling-agent-becomes-your-buyer).*

### Single Party Compensation Option

Want to test if your marketing is working? I offer **Single Party Compensation Agreements** where you pay ZERO buyer agent commission. If buyers find you without an agent, you save $7,000-$42,000 in commissions.

Only about 2% of agents in Santa Clarita offer this. Ask me how it works when you book your consultation.

## Valencia Neighborhoods to Watch in 2026

Based on recent sales data and buyer demand, these Valencia neighborhoods are showing strong performance:

- **Bridgeport** - Newer construction, highly desirable
- **Westridge** - Established neighborhood with excellent schools
- **Valencia Northbridge** - Strong resale values
- **Creekside** - Family-friendly with good lot sizes

## Bottom Line: Valencia Sellers Have a Window of Opportunity

The January 2026 Valencia market is balanced, predictable, and professional. It's not the chaos of 2024, and it's not the sluggishness of mid-2025.

**270 active listings and 53 days to sell** means:
- ✅ Properly priced homes are selling
- ✅ Buyers are active and qualified
- ✅ Sellers have leverage if they prepare correctly

If you're thinking about selling your Valencia home, now is the time to get serious about preparation. The market is forgiving to sellers who do it right, but punishing to those who overprice or neglect presentation.
