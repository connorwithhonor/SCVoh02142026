# Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Update: May 26, 2025 - Insights from Connor with Honor

Good day everybody, and welcome to this deep dive into the Santa Clarita real estate market as of May 26th, 2025. I'm Connor MacIvor, your First Responder Realtor, also known as Connor with Honor. My goal today is to provide you with a comprehensive overview of what's happening here in the valley, shed light on key trends, and equip you with essential knowledge whether you're preparing to sell a cherished home or embark on the exciting journey of purchasing a new residence. My website, SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com, is always your primary resource for all things real estate in Santa Clarita and Southern California, and I leverage my unique background, including 17 years with the LAPD and my ongoing work in Artificial Intelligence, to offer unparalleled service and insights.

&nbsp;

Watch my full market update for May 26, 2025.

## The Evolving Landscape of Santa Clarita Inventory: What the Numbers Tell Us

The real estate market is a dynamic ecosystem, constantly influenced by a myriad of factors, and observing its inventory is like reading its pulse. Over the past month and a half, we've witnessed a notable and consistent increase in the residential units available for sale across the Santa Clarita Valley. This isn't merely a minor seasonal blip; it's a significant trend worth close attention. As of today, May 26th, 2025, at 10:00 AM, our Multiple Listing Service (MLS) reflects a total of 738 active residential listings for sale in the valley[cite: 3]. This figure represents a substantial jump of nearly 200 units since the beginning of the year[cite: 5]. This upward trajectory in available homes is a critical piece of information for both buyers and sellers, signaling a shift in the market dynamics that demands strategic adaptation.

We anticipate this pattern of increasing inventory to continue as we progress further into the summer months and early fall. This is a common seasonal phenomenon, as many homeowners choose these periods to list their properties. However, as the year draws to a close and we approach the holiday season, we generally expect to see a natural reduction in the number of new listings coming onto the market[cite: 5]. Understanding these cyclical patterns allows us to better prepare and advise our clients on the optimal timing for their real estate endeavors.

### Implications for Santa Clarita Home Sellers: Navigating Heightened Competition

For those of you in the Santa Clarita Valley who are contemplating selling your homes, this surge in inventory translates directly into a more competitive market environment. When the supply of homes increases without a proportional increase in buyer demand, buyers gain more leverage, and properties may take longer to sell or require more strategic pricing and presentation to stand out. Many of the sellers I speak with are facing significant life transitions, and it's fascinating to observe the common threads among their motivations. A prevalent reason for selling, which I hear frequently, is the decision to relocate out of state, often driven by their adult children who have already made such a move[cite: 4]. These families are choosing new communities in places like Utah, North Carolina, Tennessee, Idaho, and Northern Nevada[cite: 4].

My clients often express a complex mix of emotions about this transition. On one hand, there's a palpable excitement, almost a "giddiness," about embarking on a new chapter, or as I like to say, an entirely new "book" in their lives[cite: 4, 5]. For many, this means leaving a home they've lived in for 30, 40, or even 50 years, where they've raised their families and built decades of memories[cite: 5]. This deep emotional connection often comes with a degree of apprehension and fear, particularly for those who have spent the majority of their lives in California[cite: 4]. As your [First Responder Realtor](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/first-responder-realtor-i-just-dont-take-care-of-clients-i-was-one-100), my commitment extends beyond just facilitating a transaction; it's about providing empathetic guidance through these profound life changes. We work together to craft a strategy that not only navigates the increased competition but also honors the emotional significance of selling your home.

In a market with more inventory, effective pricing becomes even more critical. Overpricing your home in a competitive environment can lead to prolonged market time and ultimately a lower sale price. It's about finding that sweet spot where your home is attractive to buyers while still maximizing your return. This involves a meticulous [market analysis](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/free-market-analysis) and a keen understanding of buyer psychology. We also focus on preparing your home to make the best possible first impression, ensuring it stands out amidst the growing selection. For a comprehensive guide to selling your home in this evolving market, I invite you to explore my [Sellers Guide](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/sellers-guide) and understand the importance of choosing the [best listing agent](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/how-to-choose-the-best-listing-agent-in-santa-clarita-home-seller-must-knows).

### Strategic Insights for Santa Clarita Home Buyers: Making Informed Decisions

For buyers, the current market presents both opportunities and critical areas requiring diligent attention. With more homes available, you have a wider selection and potentially more room for negotiation. However, it's paramount to approach your home search with a clear understanding of the nuances that can significantly impact your long-term satisfaction and financial stability. Beyond the visual appeal of a property, delve into the details that truly define your future living experience.

#### Unpacking Mello-Roos Taxes and HOA Dynamics: Your Financial Foundation

When considering a home in the Santa Clarita Valley, two of the most significant financial elements to scrutinize are Mello-Roos taxes and Homeowners Association (HOA) fees. These are often misunderstood or overlooked, but they can dramatically affect your monthly housing costs. For Mello-Roos, it’s not enough to simply know if they apply to a property. You need to understand their exact termination dates—what I refer to as "drop dead dates"[cite: 6]. It’s vital to confirm if these dates are absolute or if there's any mechanism for their extension, which could prolong your financial obligation. This clarity is crucial for accurate long-term budgeting and avoiding unexpected expenses.

The HOA is another critical component, especially in planned communities prevalent throughout Santa Clarita. Beyond the monthly fee, you need to understand its primary function: what services does it cover, what are its responsibilities, and how does it operate[cite: 6]? A key distinction lies in whether the HOA is locally managed by a board of residents or by an external management company[cite: 6, 7]. A locally managed HOA, while seemingly more personable, can sometimes present challenges. I’ve heard countless stories of board members who, despite having very limited actual authority, seem to "thrive on that kind of power"[cite: 7]. This can lead to personal disputes, slow decision-making, or even arbitrary rule enforcement that can be problematic for residents. On the other hand, an HOA managed by an external company might offer a more professional and impartial approach, but it can also feel less responsive. You might find yourself "standing in line, an email, trying to get anybody to connect with you about maybe a perceived problem"[cite: 8]. Each structure has its pros and cons, and understanding which applies to your prospective home is crucial for gauging if it’s a good fit for your lifestyle and expectations. Never neglect to thoroughly investigate these aspects; your future peace of mind depends on it.

#### Vetting Schools: Beyond the Rankings, Toward Real Experience

For families with school-aged children, the quality of local schools is undeniably a top priority. While readily available online resources and school apps provide awards and rankings, I caution against relying solely on these metrics[cite: 8]. In my experience, these systems can sometimes mirror the real estate world, where "we could pay a company, an expert, to refer us as their chosen agent and all that other horse crap"[cite: 9]. To truly vet a school, you need to go beyond the screen. My strongest recommendation is to "talk to 'em folks"[cite: 9]. If you’re seriously considering a neighborhood, take the initiative to "drop by the school and say, ‘Hey, is there somebody I can talk to here? Because I'm moving into the area, my kids are gonna be going to the school, I would kind of like to interview somebody and see what it's all about’"[cite: 11, 12].

School administrators rarely receive such direct requests, and as a result, "I'm sure they would roll out the red carpet for you"[cite: 12]. This face-to-face interaction offers invaluable insights that no online data point can provide. You can sense the school's atmosphere, ask specific questions about programs, class sizes, parent involvement, and how they handle student support. If, however, they are dismissive or unhelpful, "well, you'll have to do what you have to do," and that experience itself speaks volumes about the school's culture[cite: 12]. This proactive approach ensures you're making a decision based on real-world observation and direct communication, rather than abstract metrics.

#### Choosing Your Real Estate Advocate: The Connor with Honor Standard

The selection of your real estate agent is arguably one of the most critical decisions in your home buying journey. This individual will be your guide, negotiator, and protector throughout what can be a complex and often emotional process. My advice for vetting a Realtor mirrors my recommendation for schools: engage them directly and observe their conduct. A simple yet effective method is to "just have them show you one house and see how they do it"[cite: 9]. Contact an agent and express interest in viewing a property, and then pay close attention to their behavior from the moment they respond.

First and foremost, a professional and ethical buyer's agent should send you a [buyer-broker agreement](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/buying-a-home-key-considerations-before-signing-a-buyer-broker-agreement) before showing you any homes[cite: 9, 10]. This agreement formalizes your working relationship, outlines their fiduciary duties to you, and ensures that they are truly representing your best interests, not the seller's. Once you're at the property, listen intently to "what he talks about when he gets to the house"[cite: 10]. Is the agent genuinely focused on protecting your interests, or are they simply trying to close a sale, telling you, "you need to buy this house right now or it's all gonna be a bad for you in the future"[cite: 10]? That kind of pressure is a significant red flag.

As a retired LAPD officer, I bring a unique perspective and a lifetime of experience in observation and protection to every client interaction. While I'm "no contractor," having been doing this since 1998, "there are things I would look at if I was buying the house myself or having one of my family members buy the house"[cite: 10, 11]. This includes visible indicators of potential issues with the roof, electrical, or plumbing. "These are things that I do with all of my buyers"[cite: 11]. This proactive approach and critical eye are "a good way to gauge whether or not the buyer's agent you're selecting is truly certified and proper and really is reviewed like they show online"[cite: 11]. Your agent should be a detective, anticipating issues and providing transparent, honest assessments, not just a salesperson. My ultimate goal is to add [value to the home buyer experience](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/adding-value-to-the-home-buyer-experience-one-honest-sale-at-a-time) by acting as a true guardian of your investment.

#### The Non-Negotiable Step: Getting Prequalified

Before you even step foot into a potential dream home, the single most important step for any serious buyer is to get [prequalified by a legitimate lender](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/get-pre-approved)[cite: 12]. This isn't just a suggestion; it's a fundamental requirement in today's competitive market. Prequalification establishes your "affordability factor"[cite: 13], giving you a clear understanding of your borrowing power. It allows you to determine "where those payments are gonna be about" and "where your interest rate might be"[cite: 13]. While the specific property you choose and the exact day you lock in a rate can cause minor fluctuations, a pre-approval provides a reliable "ballpark figure on what your payments going to be"[cite: 13]. A reputable lender can provide this crucial information, empowering you to search for homes within a realistic budget and avoid the disappointment of falling in love with a property you cannot afford. Moreover, a pre-approval letter signals to sellers that you are a serious, qualified buyer, giving your offers more weight in a competitive multiple-offer situation. For detailed information on mortgage rates and loan types, please visit my [Mortgage Rates page](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/mortgage-rates) and review the [2025 Santa Clarita Mortgage Guide](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/your-2025-santa-clarita-mortgage-guide-rates-loan-types-and-buying-strategies).

## Strategic Pricing for Santa Clarita Sellers: Beyond the Surface

For sellers in the Santa Clarita Valley, especially as the market becomes more competitive with increasing inventory, strategic pricing is paramount. It’s about much more than just looking at recent comparable sales. While [comparables](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/free-market-analysis) provide a baseline, they rarely capture the full essence and unique value of your home, particularly if it's a truly special property. As I often emphasize, "don't ever let that sale price be so dependent on comparables, especially if your house is somewhat of a unicorn"[cite: 13, 14].

What makes a home a "unicorn" in the real estate market? It's a property that possesses "special attributes" that are not readily found elsewhere[cite: 14]. This could be anything from unique architectural design, custom high-end finishes, an exceptionally large and private lot, panoramic views, sustainable features like advanced solar systems, or even a meticulously landscaped backyard oasis. Buyers are not just purchasing square footage and bedrooms; they are investing in a lifestyle, a feeling, and a unique experience. When a home offers something genuinely distinctive, "buyers are willing to accept paying more for things that they're not gonna find elsewhere; that's a fact"[cite: 14].

My role as your First Responder Realtor is to meticulously identify and articulate these special attributes. This involves a comprehensive evaluation that goes beyond standard market data. We look at upgrades, unique features, and the intangible value that your home offers. We then strategically position your property to highlight these unique selling propositions, ensuring that the target buyer who values these features is not only aware of them but also compelled to make a strong offer. This proactive approach to pricing, coupled with a robust [marketing plan](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/complete-santa-clarita-real-estate-marketing-plan-to-get-your-home-sold), is designed to attract the right buyer who recognizes and is willing to pay for your home's distinct advantages. In a market with more choices, differentiating your property effectively is the key to achieving the highest possible sale price in the shortest amount of time. I also encourage you to read my insights on [why pricing your home too high may be the reason it's not selling](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/pricing-your-home-too-high-maybe-the-reason-its-not-selling).

## The Unseen Advantage: Accessing "Coming Soon" Listings

In a dynamic real estate market like Santa Clarita's, information is currency, and early access to that information can be a significant competitive edge. This is precisely where my exclusive "Coming Soon" program becomes invaluable, particularly for buyers who are serious about finding their ideal home before it becomes widely available to the masses. These are properties that are in the pre-marketing phase and are not yet listed on major public real estate platforms such as Zillow or Redfin. In fact, you won't even find them directly displayed on my own public website, [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/)[cite: 15].

This means that while other buyers are sifting through publicly available listings, you could be among the first to learn about and potentially view properties that perfectly match your criteria. This early access can be the difference between securing your dream home and missing out. For those of you who currently do not have a dedicated real estate agent representing your interests, I strongly encourage you to take advantage of this unique opportunity. Simply visit [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/comingsoon](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/coming-soon-listings-see-the-homes-for-sale-before-zillow-and-redfin-get-them) to gain access to this exclusive inventory[cite: 14, 15].

The process is straightforward: just let me know which city or cities within the Santa Clarita Valley you're interested in, and I will personally send these listings directly to your email[cite: 14, 15]. You might be wondering about the volume of these exclusive listings. Currently, it's a manageable number. We have 23 "Coming Soon" listings that have been pre-slotted, meaning they are ready for private viewing before their public debut[cite: 15]. Typically, you can expect to receive perhaps two or three such listings each day, ensuring that you're not overwhelmed but consistently informed of new, exclusive opportunities[cite: 15]. This proactive approach helps you stay "ahead of the competition"[cite: 14].

This early intelligence allows you to:

	- **Be Proactive:** Review properties and express interest before they generate widespread attention.

	- **Gain an Edge:** Potentially view homes and even make offers before other buyers even know they're on the market.

	- **Reduce Competition:** In some cases, a well-placed early offer on a "coming soon" listing can avoid the competitive bidding wars often seen on publicly listed properties.

If you already have a real estate agent, I encourage you to reach out to them and ask if they can provide you with access to "Coming Soon" inventory. However, if you're unrepresented or simply seeking an agent who offers this level of proactive service and exclusive access, then contact me directly. This program is just one facet of how I leverage my expertise and network to give my clients a distinct advantage in the Santa Clarita real estate market.
