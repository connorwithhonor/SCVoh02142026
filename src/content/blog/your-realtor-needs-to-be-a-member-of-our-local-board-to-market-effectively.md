I'm Connor with Honor, your local Realtor and a "full member" of multiple Boards of Realtors.&nbsp;

Why does this matter when it seems apparent that the multiple listing services share their data? Actually, they do not. I see listings, for example, which are in our local Board, and they are not reflected in other boards - such as one which shares our northern border - the Greater Antelope Valley Board of Realtors. That may not mean much, but when it comes to the agents looking at the local inventory, they won't be seeing the home you have for sale if you listed it by a Realtor who is not within, "did not pay for membership and listing advertising/propagation", the local Board of Realtors where you home, condo or townhome is located.&nbsp;

They are relying on the Syndication&nbsp;Websites to sell your home and advertise and market it, but the issue with that is now your home is being placed on systems that are showing what they "think" your home is worth. To add insult to injury, if you are a property owner wanting to rent your home out, there is no better way than with the MLS systems, they also say what you should be asking for rent due to the "program" they have running in the background.

With sarcasm - I'm sure you love to be told what you can charge, as do I :)

HIRE LOCAL. Or hire an agent who did what I did, as I sell homes and represent home buyers in the Antelope Valley as well. I pay the extra fee's in order to access their real estate listing and multiple listing data. Without it, I venture to say I'd miss out on 50% of the home listings if relying on my "local Board of Realtors" data.

Look it up, the Southland Regional Association of Realtors and the Greater Antelope Board of Realtors, don't share their data with each other. It is not a problem. However, when hiring an agent, it's important to have your home that is being offered for sale in the proper board so the clients/agents/potential consumers see all your housing data.

This list of home was a run within the local Southland Regional Association of Realtors as of today 10/24/2024, 0808hrs. AS you can see there are blanks where the subdivisions should be appearing. Those listings are by agents who have been hired by unsuspecting sellers to sell their homes. Those sellers probably hired from the listing syndication websites and on the social media advertisements paid for by those same systems. Now, if an agent is searching, or if a consumer is searching by neighborhood or by subdivision, which a lot of serious buyers are, they won't see your home for sale.

Now onto today's real estate update. I'm Connor with honor.

### Santa Clarita Real Estate Update – October 24th, 2024: Price Changes, New Listings, and Market Insights

Welcome to your latest Santa Clarita real estate update for October 24th, 2024. I’m **Connor MacIvor**, your “First Responder Realtor,” always delivering with "Connor with Honor." This update brings you the latest numbers on price changes, new listings, and insights on the Santa Clarita Valley housing market.

If you are considering **buying a home in Santa Clarita**, **selling a home in Santa Clarita**, or just want to stay informed, this blog will give you an in-depth look at the trends and data that are shaping the real estate landscape. It’s packed with the latest updates, tips on how to navigate this market, and essential information for both home buyers and sellers.

### Market Overview: A Snapshot of Santa Clarita Real Estate

In the past seven days, the Santa Clarita real estate market has seen significant movement:

### Price Changes: A Crucial Element for Sellers

Over the past week, price reductions have become a key trend. Sellers are adjusting to the market to stay competitive. **97 listings have dropped their asking prices**, which is critical in this market where pricing can make or break a deal. As we approach the end of the year, the market is showing signs of stabilization, but sellers need to stay on top of pricing trends to keep their homes moving.

For instance, we saw a significant price drop for a property in **Plum Canyon**, which is now listed at **$1,163,300**. Price adjustments like these are essential to maintain competitiveness, especially as the number of homes for sale increases.

#### Why Price Reductions Matter

When you adjust your home’s price, it doesn’t just make your listing more attractive to potential buyers, but it also updates the syndication networks such as Zillow, Realtor.com, and Redfin, pushing your property to a wider audience. This is especially critical when homes are initially priced too high. The syndication platforms automatically update, giving more visibility and bringing in more potential buyers.

### The Impact of Using a Local Realtor in Santa Clarita

A critical point for sellers is to **make sure your agent is a member of the local Board of Realtors**. Why does this matter?

When your agent is not part of the local board, your listing may lack essential details in the MLS (Multiple Listing Service), including subdivision information and neighborhood specifics. These are the kinds of data points savvy buyers are looking for, and without them, your property may not even come up in some buyer searches.

For instance, if a buyer is searching for homes near specific schools, close to freeways, or within certain neighborhoods, your home might not be shown to them if the data is incomplete. **This can lower the perceived value of your home** on syndication sites like Zillow, where a home priced at $900,000 might appear to be worth only $850,000 due to missing information.

Working with a local agent ensures that your property is correctly listed, properly marketed, and shown to as many qualified buyers as possible. **Do not underestimate the value of full exposure in the local market**.

### Featured Listings: Highlights from This Week

These examples highlight the diversity of homes available in Santa Clarita. The market is robust, with homes ranging from affordable townhomes to luxury estates, catering to a wide array of buyer needs.

### Buying a Home in Santa Clarita: What You Need to Know

Whether you're a first-time buyer or an experienced investor, navigating the **Santa Clarita real estate market** can be a challenge. Here are a few key things to keep in mind:

### Selling a Home in Santa Clarita: Essential Tips

### The Importance of Hiring a Local Realtor

A major mistake I see sellers make is hiring a realtor who isn’t local. Not only does this affect the data completeness of your listing, but it also reduces your home’s exposure. Santa Clarita is a tight-knit community with unique neighborhoods, and having a local agent who knows the area is crucial to maximizing your property’s value.

If your realtor isn’t a member of the local board, your listing may lack important details that buyers in Santa Clarita are looking for. This could cost you in terms of both time on the market and final sale price.

### What's Next in Santa Clarita Real Estate?

Looking ahead, it’s likely that we’ll see continued price adjustments as sellers adapt to the current market conditions. Inventory is higher than it was just a few months ago, and while **buyer activity remains strong**, sellers should be prepared for a slightly slower market as we move into the holiday season and election year.
