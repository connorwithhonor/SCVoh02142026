Welcome to my journey, where I share the real struggles and triumphs of transforming from fat to fit. Today is August 5th, and it's 6:33 AM. I haven't hit the gym yet, but trust me, it's on the agenda. What I want to talk about today is something that has been my saving grace throughout this transformation – fasting.

You see, fasting isn't just about not eating. It's a profound mental and physical challenge that requires immense willpower. If you've ever thought that stopping eating doesn't require willpower, I'm here to tell you that you're mistaken. There are countless people who talk about fasting as if it's the easier alternative to restricting calories. Let me be clear: both are tough, both have their challenges, and both require a strong mindset.

My fasting protocol, which I've discussed extensively, has been crucial to my success. It’s not just about the physical benefits; it's about the mental fortitude it builds. When I first started, it was incredibly difficult. The initial days felt like an insurmountable wall, but I pushed through. The sense of accomplishment when you overcome the urge to eat is empowering. It's a testament to your willpower, and it builds a resilience that permeates other areas of your life.

I remember the days when I weighed 365 pounds with a 65-inch waist. It was daunting to even think about getting fit. But embracing fasting, alongside my workouts, set me on the path to shedding 135 pounds of fat. Today, I stand at 6'1" with a 34-inch waist, weighing 230 pounds of lean muscle. The transformation didn't happen overnight, and it certainly wasn't easy. It took dedication, a structured approach to fasting, and relentless willpower.

One of the key elements of my fasting regimen is understanding that hunger is a temporary state. It's your body's way of trying to maintain the status quo. But once you get past that initial hunger wave, your body adjusts. You learn to distinguish between actual hunger and psychological cravings. This distinction is crucial because it empowers you to make conscious decisions about your eating habits.

Another aspect that helped me was the support system I built around me. Having people who understand your journey and encourage you makes a huge difference. My partner, Roxana, has been a pillar of support. We work out together, and her presence has been a constant source of motivation. It's essential to surround yourself with positivity and people who believe in your goals.

If you're considering fasting, here are a few tips to get you started:

	- 
	**Start Slow:** Don't jump into prolonged fasting immediately. Begin with intermittent fasting and gradually increase the duration as your body adapts.

	

	- 
	**Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water. Sometimes, what we perceive as hunger is actually thirst.

	

	- 
	**Stay Busy:** Keeping yourself occupied helps distract from thoughts of food. Engage in activities that you enjoy or take up new hobbies.

	

	- 
	**Listen to Your Body:** Fasting isn't about punishing yourself. If you feel unwell, it's okay to break your fast. Listen to your body's signals.

	

	- 
	**Mental Preparation:** Prepare yourself mentally for the challenge. Visualize your goals and remind yourself why you're doing this.

	

Fasting has been a game-changer for me, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Find what works best for you and stay committed to your journey. Remember, the road to fitness is a marathon, not a sprint. Embrace the process, celebrate small victories, and keep pushing forward.
