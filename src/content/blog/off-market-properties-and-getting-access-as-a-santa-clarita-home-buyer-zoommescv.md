	- **13 Coming Soon Listings**: Properties slated to hit the market soon, giving buyers a chance to get ahead of the competition. Check out [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/comingsoon](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/comingsoon) for a sneak peek.

	- **30 Properties Back on Market**: These listings fell out of escrow, presenting potential deals for savvy buyers. See what’s available at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings).

	- **55 Pending Sales**: These properties are no longer accessible to the public, indicating strong buyer activity. Get insights at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-real-estate-market-update-july-9-2024-hottest-neighborhoods](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-real-estate-market-update-july-9-2024-hottest-neighborhoods).

	- **64 Closed Sales**: Transactions completed this week, showing robust market movement. Review recent sales at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/my-sold-listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/my-sold-listings).

	- **5 Expired, 22 Canceled, 14 On Hold, 5 Withdrawn**: A total of 46 listings are in limbo, offering unique opportunities for buyers willing to dig deeper. Ask your agent to track these at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings).

These numbers paint a picture of a vibrant market with opportunities for both buyers and sellers. However, the key to capitalizing on these trends lies in working with a knowledgeable realtor who can uncover hidden gems, especially among canceled or withdrawn listings. For personalized guidance, schedule a consultation at [https://www.zoommescv.com/](https://www.zoommescv.com/).

#### Why Canceled, Expired, and Withdrawn Listings Matter

One of the most overlooked opportunities in real estate lies in listings that are no longer active but haven’t returned to the market. In the past week alone, 46 properties fell into the categories of expired (5), canceled (22), on hold (14), or withdrawn (5). These listings could represent motivated sellers who are open to negotiation, especially if their properties didn’t sell due to pricing, marketing, or other factors.

**Pro Tip**: Ask your realtor to track these listings for you, ideally going back 45 to 60 days. These properties may not be widely advertised, but a skilled agent can reach out to the listing agent to inquire about their status. For example, a canceled listing might be due to a seller’s personal circumstances rather than an issue with the property itself. By exploring these opportunities, you could find a home that perfectly matches your criteria at a potentially lower price.

To ensure you don’t miss out, visit [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings) and work with a realtor who knows how to navigate these off-market opportunities. I’ve helped countless clients secure deals on properties others overlooked, and I’m ready to do the same for you.

#### Vetting Your Lender: A Critical Step for Buyers

When buying a home in Santa Clarita, choosing the right lender is as important as selecting the right property. As a former first responder, I’ve seen how preparation and due diligence can make or break a situation, and real estate is no different. Here’s why vetting your lender is crucial and how to do it effectively:

	- **Request a Good Faith Estimate (GFE)**: Even without a specific property in mind, ask your lender for a GFE based on a typical home price in your target range. For example, if you’re looking at homes around $850,000 (a sweet spot in Santa Clarita), request a breakdown of costs, including interest rates, closing costs, and fees. Learn more about financing at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/the-advantages-of-different-types-of-mortgage-lenders](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/the-advantages-of-different-types-of-mortgage-lenders).

	- **Factor in Additional Costs**: In Santa Clarita, some areas have homeowners association (HOA) fees or Mello-Roos taxes, which can significantly impact your monthly payments. Mello-Roos taxes, often used to fund infrastructure like street lighting or emergency services, can add hundreds to your bill. Check [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-real-estate-faqs](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-real-estate-faqs) for details on local taxes and fees.

	- **Compare Lenders**: Not all lenders are created equal. Some offer lower rates but higher fees, while others may provide better service but less competitive terms. Ask for transparency on all costs and compare multiple lenders to find the best fit. For guidance, visit [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/getting-a-legitimate-lender-and-getting-pre-approved](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/getting-a-legitimate-lender-and-getting-pre-approved).

By thoroughly vetting your lender, you’ll have a clearer picture of your budget and avoid surprises during escrow. Need help finding a trustworthy lender? I can connect you with reliable professionals. Book a consultation at [https://www.zoommescv.com/](https://www.zoommescv.com/) or call 661-888-4983.

#### For Sellers: Understanding Your Net Sheet

If you’re selling a home in Santa Clarita, one of the most powerful tools at your disposal is the net sheet. This document provides a clear breakdown of what you’ll walk away with after the sale, accounting for commissions, escrow fees, title costs, and any outstanding mortgage balance. Here’s why it matters:

	- **Transparency on Costs**: A net sheet outlines all expenses, including negotiable commissions and non-negotiable fees like escrow and title costs. Some sellers may also need to cover HOA document fees or other charges. Review the process at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-is-a-net-sheet-important-to-view-before-accepting-any-offers](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-is-a-net-sheet-important-to-view-before-accepting-any-offers).

	- **Negotiation Power**: Commissions are negotiable, and understanding your net sheet empowers you to discuss terms with your realtor. For insights on commission structures, visit [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/home-sellers-in-santa-clarita-will-be-able-to-pay-less-than-typical-commissions](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/home-sellers-in-santa-clarita-will-be-able-to-pay-less-than-typical-commissions).

	- **Avoid Surprises**: Knowing your net proceeds helps you plan your next move, whether it’s buying another home or relocating. For tips on selling, check out [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/sell-your-home-santa-clarita-now](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/sell-your-home-santa-clarita-now).

As a first-responder-turned-realtor, I prioritize transparency and ensure my clients understand every aspect of their net sheet. Want a customized net sheet for your property? Contact me at [https://www.zoommescv.com/](https://www.zoommescv.com/) or 661-888-4983.

#### The Role of Mello-Roos Taxes in Santa Clarita

Mello-Roos taxes are a unique feature of some Santa Clarita neighborhoods, particularly newer developments. These taxes fund community infrastructure, such as street lighting, schools, or emergency services, but they can significantly increase your monthly housing costs. Here’s what you need to know:

	- **What Are Mello-Roos Taxes?**: These are special assessments levied on homeowners in certain districts to cover infrastructure costs. Unlike standard property taxes (approximately 1.25% in Los Angeles County), Mello-Roos can vary widely and may last for decades. Learn more at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-real-estate-faqs](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-real-estate-faqs).

	- **Impact on Buyers**: If you’re eyeing a home in a Mello-Roos area, factor these taxes into your budget. They can add hundreds of dollars to your monthly payment, so ask your lender to include them in your GFE.

	- **How to Identify Them**: Not all Santa Clarita properties have Mello-Roos taxes, but they’re common in newer communities like Valencia or Stevenson Ranch. Check specific listings at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-valencia-ca](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-valencia-ca) or [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-stevenson-ranch-ca](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-stevenson-ranch-ca).

To avoid surprises, work with a realtor who understands local tax structures. I’ve guided countless buyers through the complexities of Mello-Roos, and I’m here to help you. Schedule a consultation at [https://www.zoommescv.com/](https://www.zoommescv.com/).
