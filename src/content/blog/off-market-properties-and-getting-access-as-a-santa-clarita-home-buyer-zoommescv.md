The Santa Clarita real estate market is buzzing with activity as of July 17, 2025, and whether you're a buyer or seller, staying informed is critical to making smart decisions. I’m Connor MacIvor, a former LAPD motor cop turned real estate expert with over 25 years of experience, and I’m here to break down the latest market trends and provide actionable insights. From new listings to price changes and the importance of vetting your lender, this update will equip you with the knowledge to navigate the market like a pro. Let’s dive into the numbers and strategies to help you succeed, whether you’re hunting for your dream home or selling your property in Santa Clarita Valley.

#### Santa Clarita Market Snapshot: The Numbers You Need to Know

The Santa Clarita real estate market is dynamic, with significant activity over the past seven days. Here’s a breakdown of the latest data:

These numbers paint a picture of a vibrant market with opportunities for both buyers and sellers. However, the key to capitalizing on these trends lies in working with a knowledgeable realtor who can uncover hidden gems, especially among canceled or withdrawn listings. For personalized guidance, schedule a consultation at [https://www.zoommescv.com/](https://www.zoommescv.com/).

#### Why Canceled, Expired, and Withdrawn Listings Matter

One of the most overlooked opportunities in real estate lies in listings that are no longer active but haven’t returned to the market. In the past week alone, 46 properties fell into the categories of expired (5), canceled (22), on hold (14), or withdrawn (5). These listings could represent motivated sellers who are open to negotiation, especially if their properties didn’t sell due to pricing, marketing, or other factors.

**Pro Tip**: Ask your realtor to track these listings for you, ideally going back 45 to 60 days. These properties may not be widely advertised, but a skilled agent can reach out to the listing agent to inquire about their status. For example, a canceled listing might be due to a seller’s personal circumstances rather than an issue with the property itself. By exploring these opportunities, you could find a home that perfectly matches your criteria at a potentially lower price.

To ensure you don’t miss out, visit [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings](/) and work with a realtor who knows how to navigate these off-market opportunities. I’ve helped countless clients secure deals on properties others overlooked, and I’m ready to do the same for you. Reach out at 661-888-4983 or [https://www.zoommescv.com/](https://www.zoommescv.com/).

#### Vetting Your Lender: A Critical Step for Buyers

When buying a home in Santa Clarita, choosing the right lender is as important as selecting the right property. As a former first responder, I’ve seen how preparation and due diligence can make or break a situation, and real estate is no different. Here’s why vetting your lender is crucial and how to do it effectively:

By thoroughly vetting your lender, you’ll have a clearer picture of your budget and avoid surprises during escrow. Need help finding a trustworthy lender? I can connect you with reliable professionals. Book a consultation at [https://www.zoommescv.com/](https://www.zoommescv.com/) or call 661-888-4983.

#### For Sellers: Understanding Your Net Sheet

If you’re selling a home in Santa Clarita, one of the most powerful tools at your disposal is the net sheet. This document provides a clear breakdown of what you’ll walk away with after the sale, accounting for commissions, escrow fees, title costs, and any outstanding mortgage balance. Here’s why it matters:

As a first-responder-turned-realtor, I prioritize transparency and ensure my clients understand every aspect of their net sheet. Want a customized net sheet for your property? Contact me at [https://www.zoommescv.com/](https://www.zoommescv.com/) or 661-888-4983.

#### The Role of Mello-Roos Taxes in Santa Clarita

Mello-Roos taxes are a unique feature of some Santa Clarita neighborhoods, particularly newer developments. These taxes fund community infrastructure, such as street lighting, schools, or emergency services, but they can significantly increase your monthly housing costs. Here’s what you need to know:

To avoid surprises, work with a realtor who understands local tax structures. I’ve guided countless buyers through the complexities of Mello-Roos, and I’m here to help you. Schedule a consultation at [https://www.zoommescv.com/](https://www.zoommescv.com/).

#### Why Work with a First-Responder-Turned-Realtor?

My background as an LAPD motor cop, firearms instructor, and drug recognition expert gives me a unique edge in real estate. I approach every transaction with the same discipline, attention to detail, and commitment to protecting my clients that I honed on the streets. Here’s how I add value:
