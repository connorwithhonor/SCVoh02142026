**Real Estate Market Updates, Home Maintenance Tips, and First Responder Insights**

[www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/first-responder-realtor-in-santa-clarita-connor-with-honor-daily-show-284-2024](www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/first-responder-realtor-in-santa-clarita-connor-with-honor-daily-show-284-2024)

Welcome to the Santa Clarita Real Estate Update, **Day 284 of 2024**! As your **First Responder turned Realtor**, I bring a unique approach to real estate that blends my years of service and experience in law enforcement with the detailed knowledge needed to protect buyers and sellers in today’s housing market. Today’s blog post covers **market updates**, the importance of **quality home maintenance**, and the insights that come from a career in law enforcement, making sure you have everything you need to make informed decisions.

### **Santa Clarita Market Update: October 10, 2024**

Here’s the latest breakdown for all residential listings in **Santa Clarita**, including **Canyon Country**, **Castaic**, **Newhall**, **Saugus**, **Stevenson Ranch**, and **Valencia**:

	- **Coming Soon**: 9 listings

	- **New Listings**: 72

	- **Price Changes**: 57

	- **Back on Market**: 28

	- **Active Under Contract**: 39

	- **Pending**: 44

	- **Closed Sales**: 61

	- **Expired Listings**: 6

	- **Canceled Listings**: 10

	- **Hold**: 8

	- **Withdrawn**: 2

That gives us a total of **537 active residential listings**. As mortgage rates begin to dip, we’re expecting increased competition in the coming months. This is especially important for buyers who are on the fence about entering the market now versus waiting for rates to drop even further.

### **Three Risks of Waiting for Mortgage Rates to Fall**

Mortgage rates have dropped significantly, with the average 30-year fixed rate sitting at **6.25%**—down from a high of over 8%. But waiting for rates to drop even further carries risks for homebuyers:

	- 
	**More Competition**

	As rates drop, more buyers enter the market, increasing competition. In Santa Clarita, bidding wars are likely to become more common, making it harder to secure your dream home.

	

	- 
	**Fewer Seller Concessions**

	In a competitive market, sellers are less likely to offer concessions such as credits for closing costs or repairs. Now might be the best time to secure a home before sellers start tightening their offers.

	

	- 
	**Rising Home Prices**

	Lower rates often lead to higher home prices, especially in sought-after areas like **Valencia** and **Stevenson Ranch**. By buying now, you can potentially avoid paying more in the future.

### **First Responder Insights for Homebuyers and Sellers**

In my years as a police officer, attention to detail and preparation were critical. Whether it was motorcycle maintenance or preparing for high-risk situations, I learned that **upkeep** and **vigilance** are essential—both in law enforcement and in real estate. Here’s how some of these lessons apply to you as a homeowner or prospective buyer:

#### **Motorcycle Maintenance &amp; Home Care: Don’t Neglect the Details**

As a motor cop, every day began with careful inspection and maintenance of my bike. There was no room for error—every bolt had to be tightened, every part lubricated. Similarly, **home maintenance** should never be taken lightly. If you’re a homeowner, keeping up with small issues like replacing air filters, repairing loose cabinet doors, or maintaining your HVAC system can save you from larger problems down the road. Buyers notice these details during a walkthrough, just as I noticed every detail of my gear before a shift.

#### **Preparing for the Unexpected: After the Storm**

As a cop, I hated getting caught in the rain because it meant hours of carefully drying and maintaining my equipment to prevent rust and malfunction. Homeowners face the same challenge after a storm, earthquake, or other natural event. It’s crucial to walk around your property, inspect for any potential damage, and get an aerial view of your roof, especially if it’s made of tile or stone. Small cracks or displaced tiles can lead to bigger, more costly damage during the next storm. Just like I meticulously cared for my bike after rough weather, you should take the time to care for your home after every event.

#### **Hiring the Best: Like Calling in SWAT**

When things got serious in law enforcement, we called in SWAT—the best of the best. In real estate, you should have the same mindset when hiring inspectors, appraisers, or contractors. You don’t want just anyone; you want **experts** in their field. A top-notch inspector, for instance, can spot potential issues that others might miss, just like SWAT handles high-risk situations with precision.

### **Protecting Your Home Investment: From Safety Equipment to Home Features**

In law enforcement, I often had to purchase my own protective gear because the department didn’t always provide the highest quality. It was an investment in my safety, and I never regretted spending more on **better equipment**. In real estate, **home features** like high-quality windows, doors, or roofing with transferable lifetime warranties are worth the investment. These features not only enhance the value of your home but also appeal to future buyers, much like tactical gear gave me confidence and security in the field.
