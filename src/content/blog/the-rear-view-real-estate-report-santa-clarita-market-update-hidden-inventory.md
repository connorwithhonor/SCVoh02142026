# The Rear-View Real Estate Report: Santa Clarita Market Update, Hidden Inventory Strategies, and the Jewel of Bridgeport (November 13, 2025)

**Author:** Connor MacIvor (Connor with Honor) **Date:** November 13, 2025 **Location:** Santa Clarita, California

## TL;DR: The Quick Summary

**For the busy reader, here is the snapshot of the Santa Clarita Valley real estate market for mid-November 2025:**

## Introduction: Reading the Real Estate Tea Leaves

Welcome back to the channel and the blog! I’m Connor MacIvor—your "Connor with Honor," First Responder Realtor, and your guide to the Santa Clarita real estate landscape.

It is November 13, 2025. I’m fresh off a workout (dropping 135 lbs thanks to intermittent fasting and hard work has become a lifestyle, not just a phase), and I’ve been crunching the numbers since about 6:02 a.m. this morning.

Some people call looking at past data "rear-view real estate." It’s a funny term, but here is the reality: if you don’t understand where the numbers have been over the last seven days, you cannot possibly predict where they are going tomorrow. And in a market like Santa Clarita, where inventory is tightening, predicting the future is how you win.

Whether you are a buyer frustrated by a lack of options or a seller wondering if you missed the boat, this update is for you. We are going to break down the stats, look at a specific strategy to find "unlisted" homes, and tour a magnificent property in Bridgeport.

## Part 1: The Numbers Game (Market Statistics for Nov 7–13, 2025)

Let’s dive into the hard data. These numbers represent the heartbeat of the Santa Clarita Valley (SCV) housing market over the past week.

### The "In-Flow" (New Inventory)

**Analysis:** Fifty-eight new listings is a decent number, but it is barely enough to feed the current buyer demand. In a balanced market, we might see this number higher. The "Coming Soon" strategy seems to be used less frequently right now, which often happens when sellers are confident they can sell immediately upon hitting the active market without a pre-marketing period.

### The "Churn" (Status Changes)

**Deep Dive: Why "Back on Market" Matters** This number—12 properties returning to market—is statistically low for November. usually, as we approach the holidays, we see "buyer remorse" or financing issues cause more escrows to fall apart.

The fact that this number is low tells us two things:

### The "Out-Flow" (Sales &amp; Pending)

**The Velocity of Money:** With 48 homes closing in a week, money is moving. The ratio of new listings (58) to closings (48) is almost 1:1. This prevents inventory from building up, keeping us firmly in a Seller's Market.

### The "Off-Market" Indicators (Failures to Sell)

**Analysis:** These 50 properties represent the "shadow inventory" we will discuss later in this post. These are homes that were available but didn't sell. In a high-demand market, why didn't they sell? Usually, it comes down to one word: **Price.** They may have been over-promised a number by an agent that the market simply wouldn't support.

## Part 2: The Inventory Crisis

### 624 and Falling

As of this morning, we have **624 active listings** in the entire Santa Clarita Valley.

**Why is this critical?** We are trending to dip below 600 soon. For a city the size of Santa Clarita (encompassing Valencia, Saugus, Canyon Country, Newhall, Castaic, and Stevenson Ranch), 600 homes is an incredibly low supply.

**The Supply and Demand Reality:** It’s Economics 101.

Buyers are telling me, "Connor, I can't find exactly what I want." And it’s true. When you only have 600 options, and perhaps only 50 in your specific price range and neighborhood, finding "The One" feels like finding a needle in a haystack.

But what if I told you there is a way to find the needle *before* it goes into the haystack?

## Part 3: The "Hidden Market" Strategy

### How to Find a Home When Nothing is For Sale

This is the most valuable takeaway from today’s update. If you are a buyer, or an investor looking for opportunities, stop looking only at Zillow or Redfin. You need to look at the **graveyard of listings.**

Referencing the stats above, we had **11 Expired, 17 Cancelled, and 9 Withdrawn** listings this week. That is 37 homes that *were* for sale, and the owners likely still *want* to sell, but they are no longer on the active market.

### The Psychology of the Withdrawn Seller

These sellers are often frustrated.

They didn't change their mind about moving; they just gave up on the *process*.

### The "Buyer Portfolio" Approach

Most agents are lazy. They might call an expired listing and say, "I have a buyer!" The seller hears this and hangs up because they’ve heard it a thousand times. It’s the "Boy Who Cried Wolf" scenario.

**Here is how we do it differently at Connor with Honor:**

If you are my client, we don't just call. We build a **Buyer Portfolio**.

When I approach a seller who has taken their home off the market and say, "I’m not here to list your house. I’m here because my clients, the Smiths, love your backyard and have been approved for your price point. Here is their portfolio," the dynamic changes.

We aren't selling a promise; we are presenting a solution.

**Action Item for Buyers:** Ask your agent to pull a list of every home in your target neighborhood that Cancelled, Expired, or Withdrew in the last 6 months. If they won't do it, call me. I will.

## Part 4: Featured Listing Spotlight

### 23321 Beachcomber Lane, Valencia, CA 91355

**Price:** $888,000 **Neighborhood:** Bridgeport

I want to draw your attention to a specific property that represents incredible value in today's market.

### Why Bridgeport?

If you aren't familiar with Bridgeport in Valencia, it is one of the most sought-after communities in Southern California. It features a man-made lake, walking paths that rival any park, a clubhouse, and a distinct Cape Cod / East Coast architectural vibe that is rare on the West Coast.

### The House Details

At **$888,000**, this home is competitively priced.

*Disclaimer: I’d love to get this sold. If you are interested, keep it legal, keep it professional, and reach out to me for a private showing.*

## Part 5: Seller's Corner

### How Much Will You Actually Walk Away With?

One of the biggest fears sellers have is the "Net Sheet Surprise." They see a sales price of $900,000 and mentally spend that money. Then, after escrow closes, they see the check is significantly less due to:

**Stop Guessing.** I have developed a tool specifically for this. Before you even list, you need to know your bottom line.

**Go to: [HonorSold.com](https://honorelevate.com)**

This isn't a generic "Zestimate." This is a tool designed to help you understand your equity position so you can make financial decisions based on *reality*, not fantasy.

## Part 6: Buyer's Toolkit &amp; Resources

### Search Smarter, Not Harder

I mentioned in the video that I was trying a new format on my search site. I hate pop-ups. I hate being forced to register just to look at a picture of a kitchen.

I have completely unlocked my primary search portal: **[SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](/)**

## Q&amp;A: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Connor, you mentioned "Rear-View Real Estate." Is historical data really relevant in a shifting market?** **A:** Absolutely. Real estate doesn't turn on a dime; it turns like a cruise ship. The data from the last 7 days (the "rear view") gives us the trajectory for the next 30 days. Seeing a low cancellation rate this week tells me the next 30 days of closings will be strong.

**Q: Why are there so many "Price Changes" (53 this week)?** **A:** A price change usually means a price *reduction*. This indicates that while inventory is low, buyers are price-sensitive. Sellers who overreach are being forced to correct. It’s a sign of a rational market, not a bubble.

**Q: I’m a First Responder. Do you offer special services?** **A:** Yes! As a retired LAPD officer (17 years regular, 5 reserve), I understand the lifestyle, the shift work, and the unique financial situations of first responders. Check me out at **@FirstResponderRealtor** on YouTube. I speak your language.

**Q: Is AI really changing real estate?** **A:** It is revolutionizing it. I am heavily involved in the AI space (**@AIwithHonor**). From predictive analytics that help sellers time the market, to AI-driven marketing that finds buyers before they even look on Zillow, integrating AI is how I serve my clients better.
