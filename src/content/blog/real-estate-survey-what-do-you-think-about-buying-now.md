        # Housing Market Pulse: What’s Holding You Back?

        Are you on the fence about buying a home, planning to buy later, or stepping back for now? Share your thoughts anonymously—no names, no tracking. Results revealed soon!

        
        
            
            
            
             

            
                **1. Why aren’t you buying a home right now?**

                 Prices are too high—I’m waiting for a drop.
                 Mortgage rates are too high—I’m holding off.
                 Not enough homes are available—I can’t find what I want.
                 Other (please specify in the next question).
            

            
                **2. If you selected ‘Other’ for why you’re not buying, what’s the reason?**

                
            

            
                **3. How long do you plan to wait before buying a home?**

                 Less than 6 months
                 1 year
                 2 years or more
                 I’m not sure—I’m still deciding.
            

            
                **4. What’s the wildest thing you’ve heard or seen in the housing market lately?**

                
            

            
                **5. Do you think home prices will drop in 2025?**

                 Yes—I’m betting on a crash.
                 No—prices will keep rising.
                 Unsure—it’s too unpredictable.
            

            
                **6. What’s your biggest fear about buying a home right now?**

                 Overpaying and regretting it later.
                 The market crashing after I buy.
                 Not being able to afford it long-term.
                 Other (please specify in the next question).
            

            
                **7. If you selected ‘Other’ for your biggest fear, what is it?**

                
            

            
                **8. What would make you feel confident to buy a home in 2025?**

                 Lower home prices.
                 Lower mortgage rates.
                 More homes available to choose from.
                 Other (please specify in the next question).
            

            
                **9. If you selected ‘Other’ for what would make you confident, what is it?**

                
            

            
                **10. What’s one piece of advice you’d give to someone like you—on the fence about buying?**

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
