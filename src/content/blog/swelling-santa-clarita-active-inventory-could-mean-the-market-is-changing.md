#### Current Market Overview

As of today, we have 464 active listings on the market in all of Santa Clarita Valley. Our inventory has been slowly increasing over the past few weeks, which is noteworthy considering the decline we experienced for quite some time. For instance, in June 2021, we saw similarly high inventory levels, indicating a potential shift in the market dynamics.

In the past four weeks, we were at around 420-430 units for sale. This gradual increase in inventory might suggest a market leveling out if the buyer demand does not increase correspondingly. We could potentially see a transition from a seller's market to a more balanced market, and possibly into a buyer's market if the inventory continues to rise without a corresponding increase in buyer activity.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
