### Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Update - July 16, 2024

![](https://idx-acnt-ihouseprd.b-cdn.net/AR1197716/file_manager/Luxury%20real%20estate%20podcast%20with%20connor%20with%20honor%20from%20the%20hamptons%20to%20your%20hole.jpg?width=400&amp;height=401&amp;aspect_ratio=400%3A401)Welcome to the Santa Clarita real estate market update for July 16, 2024. I’m Connor MacIVOR, known as Connor with Honor, your trusted realtor and the owner and operator of SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com, the local multiple listing service website for all Santa Clarita active, sold, and in-process real estate listings. No registration required, all listings are unlocked for your convenience.

#### Current Market Overview

As of today, we have 464 active listings on the market in all of Santa Clarita Valley. Our inventory has been slowly increasing over the past few weeks, which is noteworthy considering the decline we experienced for quite some time. For instance, in June 2021, we saw similarly high inventory levels, indicating a potential shift in the market dynamics.

In the past four weeks, we were at around 420-430 units for sale. This gradual increase in inventory might suggest a market leveling out if the buyer demand does not increase correspondingly. We could potentially see a transition from a seller's market to a more balanced market, and possibly into a buyer's market if the inventory continues to rise without a corresponding increase in buyer activity.

#### Weekly Activity Breakdown

Over the past seven days, here’s a detailed look at the market activity:

	- **Coming Soon Listings**: 14 new properties are about to hit the market soon, providing more options for prospective buyers.

	- **New Listings**: 88 new properties have entered the market for sale, ranging from cozy condos to luxurious single-family homes.

	- **Price Changes**: 64 properties have experienced price changes, with the majority being price reductions. This trend often reflects sellers and agents adjusting to market feedback and conditions to attract buyers.

	- **Back on Market**: 18 properties have returned to the market, which could be due to various reasons such as failed contingencies or buyer financing issues.

	- **Active Under Contract**: 30 properties are under contract but still accepting backup offers, indicating strong interest and negotiations in progress.

	- **Pending**: 47 properties are pending sale, a clear sign of continued buyer interest and transactions moving towards closure.

	- **Closed**: 49 properties have successfully closed, marking the final step in the transaction process and new homeowners taking possession.

	- **Expired**: 5 listings have expired, which means they were not sold within the listing period and may need to be relisted or reassessed.

	- **Canceled**: 9 listings were canceled, possibly due to changes in seller circumstances or strategies.

	- **Hold**: 10 listings are on hold, meaning they are temporarily off the market but might return soon.

	- **Withdrawn**: 4 listings were withdrawn, similar to canceled but often for longer-term reasons.

#### Understanding Market Trends and Their Impact

The current increase in inventory and price adjustments suggest a shift in the market dynamics. As more properties become available and prices are adjusted, buyers have more options and possibly more negotiating power. This trend is crucial for both buyers and sellers to understand:

	- **For Sellers**: Pricing your home competitively is more important than ever. As inventory rises, buyers have more choices, and overpriced homes may linger on the market longer. Consider professional appraisals and comparative market analyses to set a realistic and attractive price.

	- **For Buyers**: With increasing inventory, now might be a great time to find a home that meets your needs. Be sure to get pre-approved for a mortgage to strengthen your position in negotiations.

#### Neighborhood Spotlight

Santa Clarita Valley is home to several desirable neighborhoods, each with its unique features and amenities. Here are some highlights:

	- **Valencia**: Known for its master-planned communities, excellent schools, and abundant parks. Valencia offers a family-friendly environment with a mix of residential options.

	- **Saugus**: This neighborhood provides a suburban feel with various parks and good schools. It’s an ideal location for families looking for a quieter lifestyle.

	- **Canyon Country**: Offering more affordable housing options, Canyon Country is perfect for first-time homebuyers or those looking for larger lots and a bit more space.

	- **Newhall**: Rich in history, Newhall combines old-town charm with modern amenities. It’s a vibrant community with cultural attractions and a variety of housing styles.

	- **Stevenson Ranch**: Known for its high-ranking schools and upscale homes, Stevenson Ranch is a sought-after neighborhood for families and professionals.

#### Tips and Insights

**Seller Tips**:

	- **Competitive Pricing**: Setting the right price is crucial in a changing market. Use recent comparable sales and professional appraisals to determine a fair price.

	- **Home Improvements**: Focus on upgrades with high returns on investment, such as kitchen remodels, landscaping, and staging.

	- **Professional Photography**: High-quality photos can make a significant difference in attracting buyers online.

**Buyer Tips**:

	- **Mortgage Pre-Approval**: Getting pre-approved for a mortgage gives you a clear budget and strengthens your negotiating position.

	- **Market Awareness**: Stay informed about market trends and be ready to act quickly on desirable properties.

	- **Home Inspections**: Ensure thorough inspections to avoid costly surprises after purchase.

**Market Insights**:

	- **Understanding Trends**: Keep an eye on inventory levels, days on market, and price trends to gauge market conditions.

	- **Negotiation Strategies**: In a balanced or buyer’s market, buyers may have more leverage in negotiations, while sellers should be prepared for offers below asking price.
