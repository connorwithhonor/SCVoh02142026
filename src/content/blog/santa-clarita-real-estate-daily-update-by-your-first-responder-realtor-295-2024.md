**Santa Clarita Real Estate Update – October 21, 2024: Market Insights and Active Inventory**

Good day, Santa Clarita! I’m Connor MacIvor, your **First Responder Realtor**—**Connor with Honor**—and today marks the **295th day of 2024**. It’s **Monday, October 21st**, and as always, I’m here with the latest real estate market updates for the Santa Clarita Valley. We’ve got new listings, price adjustments, properties in escrow, and more. Let’s dive right into the **7-day market snapshot** and take a look at what’s happening in your neighborhoods.

### **Santa Clarita 7-Day Market Snapshot**

This past week has shown some interesting shifts in the Santa Clarita real estate market. Here’s what we’ve seen:

	- **Coming Soon**: 13 homes are preparing to hit the market. These properties aren’t available just yet but will be soon, so stay tuned.

	- **New Listings**: 66 new properties have been listed in the past week. This is good news for buyers, as it provides fresh inventory and new opportunities.

	- **Price Changes**: We’ve seen **90 price adjustments**, and approximately **80% of these have been price reductions**. This reflects the need for sellers to stay competitive and adjust to the evolving market conditions. In many cases, initial pricing was set with future value expectations, but with today’s market pace, sellers are adapting quickly.

	- **Back on Market**: 18 homes have returned to the market. This happens when deals fall through, usually due to financing or inspection issues, but it’s often a second chance for buyers.

	- **Active Under Contract**: 37 homes are now under contract, moving towards closing.

	- **Pending**: 54 properties have moved to pending status, indicating they’re in the final stages of the escrow process.

### **Understanding Price Adjustments**

Let’s focus for a moment on those **90 price changes**. It’s important to note that **80% of those changes are reductions**. What does this mean for buyers and sellers? For sellers, price reductions might feel discouraging, but they’re often necessary to remain competitive in today’s market. As a **First Responder Realtor**, I always advise my clients to price their homes correctly from the beginning. Sometimes, sellers may have a future value in mind, but the reality is that pricing needs to be aligned with current market conditions to attract serious buyers.

As I’ve seen throughout my years in real estate, when a property isn’t moving within 30 days, a price adjustment can breathe new life into the listing. This is especially true in a market like today’s, where we’re seeing an increase in inventory but slightly slower sales pace.

### **Properties in Escrow and the Importance of Escrow Transparency**

One of the key takeaways from this week is the **91 homes** that are currently in escrow across the Santa Clarita Valley. This includes both **active under contract** and **pending** properties. But here’s something many buyers and sellers don’t realize: even though a home is in escrow, the final sale price is still up in the air until the deal closes. Negotiations can continue throughout escrow, and buyers and sellers often come to the table multiple times before the deal is sealed.

For buyers, this means understanding that your offer isn’t the end of the negotiation. For sellers, it’s a reminder that concessions, repairs, or credits can come into play as the transaction progresses. I’ve spent over **20 years in law enforcement** with the **LAPD** and more than **two decades selling real estate**, so I know the importance of transparency and keeping clients informed every step of the way. Whether you’re buying or selling, **Connor with Honor** means I’m committed to protecting your interests and making sure you’re never caught off guard during the transaction process.

### **Active Inventory Across Santa Clarita Valley**

As of today, we’re looking at **546 active residential listings** across the Santa Clarita Valley. Here’s how the inventory breaks down by city:

	- **Canyon Country**: 124 active listings

	- **Castaic**: 53 active listings

	- **Newhall**: 51 active listings

	- **Saugus**: 84 active listings

	- **Valencia**: 202 active listings

	- **Stevenson Ranch**: 32 active listings

These numbers reflect the overall health of the market, and it’s clear that Santa Clarita remains an active and competitive region for both buyers and sellers. Properties are moving, but at a more measured pace compared to earlier in the year. Currently, homes in the area are spending an average of **30 to 40 days on the market**, with well-priced properties in high-demand areas like **Bridgeport in Valencia** selling even faster.

### **Why Now is Still a Good Time to Buy or Sell**

Even with the market’s slight cooling, there are still plenty of opportunities for both buyers and sellers in Santa Clarita. Interest rates, while higher than a year ago, remain competitive, and buyers can still lock in great rates if they act quickly. For sellers, correctly pricing your home is crucial to attracting serious buyers and ensuring a smooth transaction.

As always, I’m here to help you navigate this market with **honor and integrity**. Whether you’re a buyer looking for the perfect home or a seller wanting to get top dollar for your property, you can trust that I’ll have your back, just like I did for my community as a first responder.

### **Final Thoughts**

That’s the market update for **October 21, 2024**! We’re seeing a steady flow of new listings, some price adjustments, and plenty of activity in escrow. As the market continues to evolve, it’s more important than ever to work with a realtor who understands the landscape and can guide you through it with **honesty and expertise**.
