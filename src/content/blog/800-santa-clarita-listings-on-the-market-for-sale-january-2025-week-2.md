## 1. Introduction: A Community at a Crossroads

Welcome to the Santa Clarita Valley (SCV), a region brimming with promise, nestled in a sweet spot between the bustling metropolis of Los Angeles and the calmer enclaves of Southern California’s inland communities. I’m **Connor with Honor**—a proud first responder, former police officer, and now a full-time real estate professional dedicated to serving the brave men and women in law enforcement, the military, emergency services, as well as every hard-working civilian who calls Santa Clarita home.

In 2025, the real estate market here in the Santa Clarita Valley is buzzing with renewed energy. We currently have around **803 active listings** across our eight main SCV cities (Valencia, Stevenson Ranch, Saugus, Newhall, Canyon Country, Castaic, Agua Dulce, and Acton). Moreover, there are **about 20 listings in the “Coming Soon”** category, ready to burst onto the scene. This post aims to give you an insider’s view of the market, focusing on up-to-date stats, key strategies for buyers and sellers, and a glimpse into what makes SCV real estate so special.

At the same time, I’m mindful of how polarized our society can be. People often ask, “Connor, how do you cater to both liberals and conservatives?” My answer: Real estate is about **community**. Owning a home—whether you lean left, right, or anywhere in between—is a unifying dream. For me, bridging these divides is as essential as bridging the gap between outdated real estate data and accurate MLS figures. That’s why I’m proud to be known as the **Hero’s Realtor**—an advocate not just for first responders but for any Santa Clarita resident who wants straight talk, professional insight, and a personal touch.

In this **5,000+ word blog post**, I’ll detail how to navigate the modern Santa Clarita real estate market, share my experiences as a **former police officer** turned real estate agent, and demonstrate how we can all come together in pursuit of the American Dream. Let’s dive in.

## 2. Santa Clarita Real Estate in Early 2025

As of **January 9, 2025**, the Santa Clarita housing market is riding a wave of momentum. Inventory, while not sky-high, is higher than the rock-bottom levels of a few years ago. We currently see:

	- **803 Active Listings** (houses, condos, and townhomes)

	- **20 Coming Soon** properties, poised to hit the market in the next few weeks

From family-friendly suburbs in Saugus to large ranch-style homes in Acton, from horse properties in Agua Dulce to the modern enclaves of Valencia, the SCV offers a diverse array of housing opportunities. More than location variety, however, the region offers the intangible: a sense of **community** you’ll feel immediately upon arriving at any local event or open house.

If you’re a buyer, now’s a good time to get serious about pre-approvals and interest rates. We’re seeing an ongoing shift in rates; though they’re not as low as the historically rock-bottom rates of yesteryear, they still remain relatively attractive. Sellers, meanwhile, are balancing the prospects of listing now (with fewer competing homes) versus waiting for spring and summer when foot traffic historically increases.

## 3. The Power of Coming Soon Listings

I mentioned **20 listings** that are designated as “Coming Soon.” These are properties that are not officially on the market but will be soon. Often, sellers and agents use the Coming Soon status to:

	- Generate early buzz

	- Perform final touch-ups

	- Allow the seller time to prepare for showings

From a buyer’s standpoint, a “Coming Soon” property can be a golden opportunity. If you can view or make a preemptive offer before the home is officially listed, you may beat out other buyers who wait until the first public open house. From a seller’s point of view, this status can help gauge interest levels and build anticipation, a bit like a movie trailer building excitement for the main release.

**Pro Tip**: Check out SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/coming-soon to see these forthcoming listings. If you see something that piques your interest, contact me or your chosen agent quickly—Coming Soon windows can be short.

## 4. Understanding the 803 Current Active Listings

In Santa Clarita, each “Active” listing might be categorized in a variety of substatuses:

	- **A** for fully Active (on the open market)

	- **C** for Coming Soon (which we covered)

	- **U** or “Active Under Contract,” meaning the seller has accepted an offer but might still be open for backups

	- **P** for Pending, a stage further along in the escrow process

When I say there are 803 active listings, that number typically refers to all properties that aren’t sold yet (not counting those that have fully closed). That figure, by the way, can change daily—sometimes hourly—as new homes hit the MLS and others are taken off the market due to sales or cancellations.

Many prospective sellers get excited about these numbers, but it’s crucial to interpret them correctly. High “active listing” volume can mean more competition among sellers but also more variety for buyers. Low inventory, on the other hand, typically drives up prices since each listed home can attract multiple offers. In the SCV, we’ve historically swung between these scenarios. Today, we’re seeing a moderate amount of inventory, which can keep the market balanced—though sellers still have an edge if their home is priced and presented correctly.

## 5. Acton Spotlight: 19 Active Listings, 0 Recent Solds

Let’s zero in on **Acton**, an SCV community known for its rural charm, spacious properties, and equestrian-friendly neighborhoods. If you scan the official records from the local MLS feed, you’ll find:

	- **29 total listings** that match the broader criteria (including statuses like Active, Pending, etc.).

	- **19** of those are strictly “Active,” meaning they’re available for showings and offers.

	- **0** sold in the last 7 days.

Among these 19 active listings, you’ll find a **median list price** of about **$891,000**. These are predominantly **Single Family Residences** (SFRs). If you crave a bit more breathing room, want a property that supports horses or other animals, or simply love the rolling hills and wide-open spaces that define Acton, these 19 properties could be your perfect fit.

Acton’s market dynamic often differs from the rest of SCV. With fewer homes and a more niche buyer pool that prizes large lots and country living, you can see fewer closings in a given week. The “0 sold” figure in the last 7 days doesn’t mean the market is slow; it just means we’re dealing with a specialized segment where buyers often take a bit more time. If you want a property that straddles a rural-lifestyle vibe with proximity to Santa Clarita’s suburban amenities, Acton deserves a closer look.

## 6. Connor with Honor: First Responder, Hero’s Realtor

### 6.1 My Background in Law Enforcement

I’m often asked: “Connor, how’d you go from police work to real estate?” The short answer is **service**. My tenure with the **Los Angeles Police Department** saw me handle calls, calm anxieties, and protect everyday citizens. I witnessed the best and worst humanity has to offer, but my passion was always forging connections and solving problems—skills that directly translate to helping families buy and sell homes.

During my career, I also discovered the challenges that first responders face in purchasing real estate, from weird shift schedules to the complexities of government loans. I made it my mission to simplify these processes for fellow officers, firefighters, veterans, and paramedics.

### 6.2 Serving Military, Police, and First Responders

A real estate transaction can be stressful—especially if you’re juggling a demanding job like law enforcement or the military. **Hero’s Realtor** isn’t just a cute title; it’s the embodiment of my commitment to:

	- **Confidentiality**: I know how critical your privacy is—especially in high-stress jobs.

	- **Flexibility**: Showings that fit your schedule, not the other way around.

	- **Resources**: VA loans, specialized lender programs, or down-payment assistance for first responders.

When you deal with me, you’re dealing with someone who’s walked that path, who knows the tension of a 12-hour shift, the complexity of a federal relocation, and the pride of wearing a uniform.

### 6.3 A Realtor for Conservatives and Liberals Alike

My background in law enforcement sometimes prompts folks to assume I cater exclusively to one side of the political spectrum. The truth is, the **Santa Clarita Valley** is a melting pot of diverse views—**liberals, conservatives, and everyone in between**. If you love your community, treat your neighbors well, and want honest guidance on real estate, we’re on the same page.

No matter your affiliation, I’m here to help you buy, sell, or invest. Perhaps you’re a progressive teacher who wants to expand your family home or a conservative business owner seeking a ranch property. I value you for your character and your commitment to making SCV a better place. Politics are secondary; my overarching mission is to be your ally in real estate.

## 7. Navigating Syndication Sites vs. MLS Data

### 7.1 How Online Estimates Get Manipulated

We live in a world of big data, marketing algorithms, and targeted ads. If you’ve ever typed your address into a real estate site, you might have noticed ads instantly popping up across social media, proclaiming how much your home is allegedly “worth.”

Here’s the rub: those automated valuations can be wildly off. Syndication sites scrape data from multiple sources—some reliable, some questionable—and generate estimates using a proprietary algorithm. In theory, these estimates help sellers gauge potential market value. In practice, they can:

	- Overestimate your home value during boom times to motivate you to list.

	- Underestimate your home value during downturns to encourage a quick sale or push you to “fix” something.

	- Bombard you with promotions from third-party lenders, iBuyers, or discount brokerages that pay for leads.

### 7.2 The Importance of Accurate Sold Data

A far better resource is the **Multiple Listing Service (MLS)**. The MLS is the official database where licensed agents list properties, record final sales prices, and keep track of days on market. My site, [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](http://santaclaritaopenhouses.com/), taps directly into MLS data, ensuring accuracy.

	- **Comparative Market Analysis (CMA)**: By analyzing the actual closed prices of nearby homes similar in style and age, a CMA helps sellers price competitively and helps buyers craft realistic offers.

	- **Active vs. Sold Comps**: Active listings hint at your current competition, but sold comps reveal how much buyers are truly willing to pay.

If an online aggregator’s “Zestimate” or “Find-Your-Home-Value-Here!” widget says your property in Valencia is worth $900,000 yet local MLS sales for identical floor plans are closing at $825,000, the aggregator is likely off by tens of thousands of dollars.

## 8. Tips for Santa Clarita Sellers

### 8.1 Pre-Inspection Advantages

In an age where buyers can get spooked by the smallest inspection detail—like a squeaky door or a leaky faucet—**pre-inspections** are an ace in the hole:

	- **Transparency**: Show potential buyers you have nothing to hide.

	- **Reduced Negotiations**: If a major issue arises in the pre-inspection, you can fix it or disclose it upfront. Buyers appreciate honesty.

	- **Competitive Edge**: If multiple sellers in your neighborhood are listing around the same time, your pre-inspection might tip the buyer’s decision in your favor.

### 8.2 Pricing Strategy vs. Market Manipulation

A well-priced home attracts serious offers quickly. Overpricing, on the other hand, might scare away buyers and cause your listing to linger on the market, ultimately leading to a lower final sales price. Underpricing can generate a bidding war in some markets, but it also carries the risk that you might leave money on the table if interest fails to materialize.

**Pro Tip**: Evaluate the **180-day sales data** in your specific Santa Clarita neighborhood. If you’re in Canyon Country, check comps from your exact tract or a similar one, factoring in bed/bath count, square footage, and lot size.

### 8.3 Setting Yourself Apart in a Competitive Market

Santa Clarita is a broad region. If you’re selling a home in Saugus, you might compete with other popular family-oriented neighborhoods. In Valencia, your competition might be new construction or well-established HOAs. Ultimately:

	- **Professional Photography &amp; Staging**: People buy with their eyes first.

	- **Online Presence**: High-resolution pictures, well-organized listing descriptions, and even short video tours can all help.

	- **Open Houses**: While some say open houses are outdated, I’m a big believer that they remain crucial for building community awareness and providing an easy, no-commitment way for buyers to see your home.

## 9. Tips for Santa Clarita Buyers

### 9.1 Getting Fully Pre-Approved

Picture this: You find a gorgeous single-family residence in Stevenson Ranch—granite countertops, spacious backyard, a pool that sparkles in the summer sun—only to lose out because you needed extra time to solidify financing. In a market like ours, time kills deals.

	- **Full Underwritten Pre-Approval**: Provide your tax returns, W-2s, pay stubs, and proof of funds so the lender can thoroughly vet you. A pre-approval letter that’s underwritten vs. just a “pre-qualification” can make a major difference in the eyes of the seller.

	- **Local Lenders**: Using a local lender who knows Santa Clarita can streamline appraisals and avoid misguided out-of-area comps.

### 9.2 HOA and CC&amp;R Investigations

Santa Clarita’s a patchwork of HOAs—some more restrictive than others. If you have multiple pets, or plan to install solar panels or a second-story balcony, be sure to:

	- **Read the Bylaws**: Check any special assessments, pet limits, or breed restrictions.

	- **Ask About Monthly Dues**: An HOA might be $100 a month, or it could be $500 if it includes a gated entry, pool, or tennis courts. Factor that into your monthly budget.

	- **Make a Quick Call**: If you’re worried your Great Dane won’t be allowed, call the HOA management before you submit an offer.

### 9.3 Finding “Off-Market” and “Coming Soon” Properties

In an era of hyperconnectivity, some of the best deals never hit the open market. Agents often network within their brokerages or local communities. If you want an edge:

	- **Request “Pocket Listings”**: Agents sometimes have properties they know about that aren’t officially on the MLS.

	- **Track “Coming Soon”**: A little initiative can let you see a home before the crowds. If you can snag an early showing, you might submit an offer that the seller accepts without a bidding war.

## 10. Open Houses: The Gateway to Community Connection

For many, the open house is purely functional: walk in, see the property, make a decision. But in Santa Clarita, open houses hold a deeper meaning:

	- **Community Building**: You run into neighbors, local business owners, or even your kids’ teachers.

	- **Neighborhood Insights**: You get a sense of local architecture, whether the neighbors keep up their yards, and the intangible “vibe” that’s impossible to glean from photos.

	- **Chance to Meet Agents**: If you’re a buyer, talking to an agent hosting an open house might yield insights on upcoming listings.

That’s why I maintain a dedicated resource: [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](http://SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com). Keep tabs on the next wave of open homes so you can plan your weekend tours, learn about new communities, and connect with the pulse of the local market.

## 11. Bridging the Gap: A Place for Liberals, Conservatives, and Everyone in Between

### 11.1 Real Estate as a Unifier

Housing is a universal need. Whether you want a cozy condo near a bustling Valencia shopping center or a five-acre spread in Agua Dulce, that dream transcends political lines. My experience—both as a **police officer** and a **realtor**—taught me that we’re more alike than we think. We all want security, stability, and a place to grow roots.

In an era where social media fosters debates more often than discussion, real estate can bring neighbors together. Selling or buying a home is a shared milestone, one that fosters empathy across ideological divides. My role is to facilitate those connections, ensuring everyone gets the respect, honesty, and service they deserve.

### 11.2 Community-Building Events and Charity

I’m a big proponent of supporting local charities, especially those assisting veterans, first responders, homeless populations, and at-risk youth. Whether you lean left or right, the act of volunteering fosters unity. Over the years, I’ve organized or participated in:

	- **Fundraisers for Wounded Officers**

	- **Toy Drives for Families in Need**

	- **Home Donation Raffles**

If you want to plug into the philanthropic side of Santa Clarita, I’d be honored to connect you with upcoming volunteer events and charities that do stellar work.

## 12. Projected Trends for 2025

### 12.1 Market Growth and Inventory Increase

As we proceed further into 2025, we anticipate **inventory** rising from 800 to potentially 1,000 or more active listings by the mid-summer point. Why?

	- **Sellers Freed by Rising Equity**: Many owners locked in historically low interest rates in previous years. As home values remain strong, these owners might finally decide to sell and “cash out.”

	- **New Construction**: Developers are building in pockets of Valencia, Canyon Country, and elsewhere, adding brand-new homes to the market.

### 12.2 Buyer Drive vs. Seller Motivation

**Buyer drive** often hinges on interest rates. If rates dip even a fraction, buyer sentiment can surge. But we also see broader economic trends—job growth, commuting patterns, or remote-work shifts—significantly impacting buyer demand. Sellers will watch these signals closely.

I caution sellers not to wait for a mythical “perfect” time; historically, those who try to time the market down to the day might lose more than they gain. The best approach: watch the local data, consult with a real estate expert (hopefully me!), and list when your personal finances and lifestyle goals align.

## 13. Conclusion: Honor, Service, and a Prosperous Future

**Santa Clarita** is more than just a cluster of suburbs in Los Angeles County; it’s a thriving metropolis in its own right, complete with robust schools, beautiful parks, tight-knit communities, and a real estate market that’s consistently proven itself resilient. As of January 9th, 2025, we see about **803 listings** on the market, **20 “Coming Soon,”** and specialized niches like Acton, with **19 active** (and no recent sales in the last 7 days), forging its own path.

For me—**Connor with Honor**—this market is an opportunity to stay true to my core mission:

	- **Serve those who serve**: Military, police, firefighters, EMTs, and all first responders who keep SCV safe.

	- **Bridge societal divides**: Real estate isn’t about who you voted for; it’s about building a life in a place you love.

	- **Provide transparency**: From pre-inspections to honest comps, from “Coming Soon” tips to negotiating the final price.

I hope this deep dive helps you see the richness of Santa Clarita’s real estate scene and the many paths to success for both buyers and sellers. If you’re looking to purchase your dream home, sell a property that no longer fits your needs, or simply learn more about how the market is evolving, I invite you to reach out.

Feel free to follow my **daily blog** at **[SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](http://SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com)** where I post fresh insights, property highlights, and behind-the-scenes stories from the frontlines of the SCV real estate world. And if you’d like to schedule a consultation—whether you’re part of the liberal or conservative camp, whether you’re in uniform, retired, or a new arrival—my door is open. Together, we’ll make 2025 a year of honor, service, and prosperity in the **Santa Clarita Valley**.

Thank you for reading and for being part of our incredible, diverse community. I look forward to meeting you at an open house, a local charity event, or even your own front porch if you welcome me in to discuss your real estate goals. Until next time, this is Connor with Honor signing off—reminding you that real estate is more than numbers; it’s about **people**, it’s about **service**, and it’s about **honor**.
