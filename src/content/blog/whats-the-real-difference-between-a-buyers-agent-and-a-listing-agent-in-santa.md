## TL;DR

A buyer's agent represents YOU and your interests when purchasing a home. A listing agent represents the SELLER and their interests when selling a home. In 2026, post-NAR settlement rules make these roles even more important: buyer's agents must have written agreements before showing homes, commissions are negotiable, and dual agency (one agent representing both sides) is discouraged but still legal in California. Most Santa Clarita buyers don't understand this distinction until they're already in escrow—which is too late. Connor MacIvor, a former LAPD officer turned Santa Clarita real estate advisor, breaks down exactly who works for whom, what each agent does, how they get paid under new 2026 rules, and why using the listing agent as your buyer's agent is almost always a terrible idea.

## The Conversation That Could Cost You $20,000

**You:** I found a house I love on Zillow. The listing agent seems really nice. Should I just work with them?

**Connor:** No. Absolutely not. That agent works for the seller, not you. If you let them represent you too, they're getting paid by both sides AND they have a legal obligation to the seller first. You're walking into a negotiation with no one protecting your interests.

**You:** But they said they'd "represent both of us fairly."

**Connor:** That's called dual agency, and it's a conflict of interest. Would you hire the same lawyer to represent you and your opponent in a lawsuit? Of course not. Real estate is the same thing—you need YOUR OWN agent.

**You:** I thought using one agent would make the deal easier and maybe save money.

**Connor:** It might make the deal easier for THEM, but it's almost always worse for you. Let me explain the difference between a buyer's agent and a listing agent, and why you need to know this BEFORE you make an offer.

## Buyer's Agent vs. Listing Agent: Who Works for Whom?

### What Is a Listing Agent?

A **listing agent** (also called a seller's agent) is hired by the homeowner to sell their property. Their job is to:

**Who they represent:** The seller (and ONLY the seller)

**Who pays them:** Traditionally, the seller paid both the listing agent and the buyer's agent out of the sale proceeds. As of August 2024 (still in effect in 2026), this has changed: buyer's agents negotiate their fees directly with buyers, and sellers decide whether to offer any compensation. More on this below.

**Key point:** The listing agent's LEGAL DUTY is to get the seller the most money and best terms possible. They are NOT looking out for your interests as a buyer, even if they're friendly and helpful.

### What Is a Buyer's Agent?

A **buyer's agent** (also called a buyer's representative) is hired by YOU to help you purchase a home. Their job is to:

**Who they represent:** YOU (and only you)

**Who pays them:** Under new 2026 rules (post-NAR settlement), you negotiate the buyer's agent fee upfront and sign a buyer broker agreement before touring homes. The fee might be paid by the seller as a concession, paid by you directly, or split—but YOU control the negotiation.

**Key point:** A buyer's agent has a LEGAL DUTY to protect your interests, get you the best deal possible, and disclose any issues that could affect your decision.

## Why This Matters in Santa Clarita (And Everywhere Else)

In Santa Clarita's competitive market—especially in hot neighborhoods like [Valencia](/), [Stevenson Ranch](/), and newer parts of [Canyon Country](/)—having YOUR OWN agent isn't optional. Here's why:

### 1. Information Asymmetry

The listing agent knows EVERYTHING about the property:

If you work with the listing agent, they're not required to share this information with you—even if it would help you negotiate. But a buyer's agent will dig for this information and use it to your advantage.

### 2. Negotiation Leverage

Imagine you're negotiating a car purchase and the salesperson says, "I represent both you and the dealership equally." Would you trust them to get you the best price? Of course not.

Real estate is the same. A listing agent's PRIMARY loyalty is to the seller. Even if they claim to "treat both sides fairly," they legally CANNOT advocate for your best interests if it conflicts with the seller's.

### 3. The 2026 Rules Make This Even More Important

Under new NAR settlement rules (effective August 2024, still in force in 2026):

This means you MUST have a clear agreement with your buyer's agent about how they'll be compensated. If you try to work with the listing agent, the fee structure becomes even murkier—and you have less leverage.

## What Is Dual Agency (And Why You Should Avoid It)

**Dual agency** occurs when one agent represents BOTH the buyer and the seller in the same transaction.

### Is Dual Agency Legal in California?

Yes, but it requires written consent from both parties. The agent must disclose the conflict of interest and explain that they CANNOT fully represent either side.

### Why Dual Agency Is a Bad Idea

Even though it's legal, dual agency creates massive conflicts of interest:

**For buyers:**

**For sellers:**

**Who wins?** The agent—because they keep both sides of the commission (typically 5-6% of the sale price instead of 2.5-3%).

**Who loses?** Usually the buyer. Studies show that dual agency transactions tend to favor sellers because the listing agent's PRIMARY relationship is with the seller. Even with "equal representation," the seller usually gets preferential treatment.

## Real-World Example: Why Dual Agency Costs Buyers Money

### Scenario: Home Listed at $750,000 in Valencia

**Without dual agency:**

**With dual agency:**

Guess who made an extra $15,000-$22,500 in commission? The dual agent.

## How Agents Get Paid in 2026 (Post-NAR Settlement)

Before August 2024, commission structures were simple: the seller paid 5-6% of the sale price, split between the listing agent and buyer's agent.

Now it's more complicated:

### Old Rules (Pre-2024):

### New Rules (2026):

### What This Means for You:

When you hire a buyer's agent in 2026, you'll sign a buyer broker agreement that specifies:

**Example:**

## FAQ: Buyer's Agent vs. Listing Agent in Santa Clarita

### Q: Can I tour a home without a buyer's agent?

**A:** Yes, but as of 2026, if you want an agent to represent you, you MUST sign a buyer broker agreement before they can show you homes. You can tour homes on your own at open houses or by contacting listing agents directly—but you won't have representation.

### Q: If I use the listing agent, will I save money on commission?

**A:** Rarely. Most listing agents will keep the full commission for themselves (5-6% instead of splitting it). Some might offer a small discount to the seller, but you won't see any savings. And you'll lose negotiation leverage, which could cost you far more than any commission savings.

### Q: Can a listing agent give me advice on how much to offer?

**A:** Legally, yes—but they're required to act in the seller's best interest. So if you ask, "Should I offer $700K or $720K?" they'll probably say, "The seller would prefer the higher offer." They WON'T tell you, "The seller is desperate and will take $680K."

### Q: What if the listing agent says they'll "represent both sides fairly"?

**A:** That's dual agency. Even if they claim to be fair, they legally CANNOT advocate for your best interests if it conflicts with the seller's. It's a conflict of interest. Always hire your own buyer's agent.

### Q: Do I have to pay my buyer's agent if the seller offers compensation?

**A:** It depends on your buyer broker agreement. Most agreements say: "If the seller offers compensation, that covers the fee. If not, the buyer pays." Always clarify this BEFORE you start working with an agent.

### Q: Can I negotiate my buyer's agent fee?

**A:** Yes. In 2026, all fees are negotiable. Discuss this upfront and get everything in writing. Some agents offer tiered pricing (full service vs. limited service).

### Q: What if I find a home online and contact the listing agent directly?

**A:** You can do that, but you're walking into the transaction unrepresented. The listing agent will likely ask you to sign a disclosure acknowledging that they represent the seller, not you. You'll be on your own for negotiations, inspections, and closing.

### Q: Can a buyer's agent show me ANY home, or just certain ones?

**A:** A buyer's agent can show you any home on the market, regardless of commission. If they're steering you toward certain homes based on their payout, that's unethical and possibly illegal. Always ask: "Are you showing me EVERY home in my budget?"

### Q: What's the difference between a buyer's agent and a buyer's representative?

**A:** They're the same thing. "Buyer's agent" and "buyer's representative" are interchangeable terms.

### Q: Can I have multiple buyer's agents at the same time?

**A:** No. When you sign a buyer broker agreement, you're committing to work with ONE agent (or their team/brokerage) for a specified period. If you want to work with multiple agents, don't sign an exclusive agreement—but most agents won't work with you without one.

## How to Choose Between a Listing Agent and a Buyer's Agent (Spoiler: Always Choose Your Own Agent)

If you're buying a home in Santa Clarita—whether in [Saugus](/), Castaic, Newhall, or Valencia—here's the rule:

**ALWAYS hire your own buyer's agent.**

Here's why:

### 1. You Get Representation

A buyer's agent has a legal obligation to protect YOUR interests. A listing agent's obligation is to the seller.

### 2. You Get Access to Off-Market Homes

Buyer's agents have access to MLS data, "coming soon" listings, and agent networks. Listing agents only care about selling THEIR listing.

### 3. You Get Better Negotiation

A skilled buyer's agent will save you more money than they cost. Even if you pay your agent 2.5% out of pocket, they'll negotiate that back (and more) in price reductions, repair credits, or closing cost concessions.

### 4. You Get Protection from Mistakes

Real estate contracts are complex. One mistake (missing a contingency deadline, waiving the wrong protection) can cost you thousands or even put you in legal jeopardy. A buyer's agent ensures you don't screw up.

### 5. You Get Post-Closing Support

A good buyer's agent stays in touch after closing, provides contractor referrals, answers questions, and helps if issues arise. A listing agent disappears the second the deal closes.

## What About "Transaction Coordinators" or "Facilitators"?

Some companies offer "transaction coordinator" services where an agent helps with paperwork but doesn't represent either side. This is NOT the same as having a buyer's agent.

**Transaction coordinators:**

**Buyer's agents:**

If you want real representation, hire a buyer's agent—not a facilitator.

## How Connor MacIvor Protects Buyers in Santa Clarita

As a former LAPD officer, I spent 20 years protecting people. Now I do it in real estate.

Here's how I approach buyer representation:

### 1. I'm YOUR Agent—Period

When you hire me (or when I refer you to a vetted agent in my network), you get 100% loyalty. I don't work with both sides. I don't play games. I represent YOU.

### 2. I Negotiate Like a Cop (Because I Was One)

LAPD trained me in hostage negotiation. Those same skills apply to real estate: stay calm under pressure, create leverage, know when to push and when to walk away. I've saved buyers $10K-$50K through aggressive negotiation.

### 3. I Explain the 2026 Rules Upfront

Buyer broker agreements can be confusing. I walk you through every clause, explain how fees work, and make sure you understand what you're signing—BEFORE you commit.

### 4. I Show You EVERY Home (Not Just the High-Commission Ones)

No steering. No games. If a home fits your criteria—whether it's in [Valencia](/), [Stevenson Ranch](/), or Acton—we'll tour it.

### 5. I Educate, Not Pressure

I want you to understand what you're buying and why. I'll explain Mello-Roos, HOA fees, property taxes, and hidden costs. I'd rather you buy a $600K home confidently than stretch to $700K and regret it.

## The Santa Clarita Referral Model: How It Works

I run a referral-based model in Santa Clarita. Here's how it works:

### Step 1: Free Consultation

You schedule a consultation and tell me what you're looking for (price range, neighborhoods, timeline).

### Step 2: Agent Matching

I match you with a vetted buyer's agent in my network who specializes in your target area. I personally vet every agent for:

### Step 3: Accountability

I stay involved throughout your transaction to ensure the agent is performing. If they drop the ball, I intervene.

### Why This Works

Most buyers hire the first agent they meet or go with a friend/family member who's "in real estate." That's how you end up with a bad agent.

I take the guesswork out. You get a PRE-VETTED agent who's proven they can deliver.

## Summary: Buyer's Agent vs. Listing Agent

### **Listing Agent:**

### **Buyer's Agent:**

### **Dual Agency:**

### **Key Takeaways for 2026:**

## Final Thoughts: Don't Go Into Battle Without Backup

Buying a home is the biggest financial decision most people ever make. You wouldn't negotiate a lawsuit without a lawyer, and you shouldn't negotiate a home purchase without a buyer's agent.

In Santa Clarita—whether you're looking at [Valencia](/), [Saugus](/), [Canyon Country](/), [Stevenson Ranch](/), or Castaic—you need someone fighting for YOU.

If you're ready to start your home search, [reach out to me](/contact). I'll match you with a vetted buyer's agent who will represent YOUR interests—not the seller's, not their own, but YOURS.

No pressure. No games. Just honest guidance from someone who's been protecting people for 20+ years.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
