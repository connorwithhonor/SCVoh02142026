# Daily Santa Clarita real estate update buyers don't get scammed when signing

**Daily Santa Clarita Real Estate Update: Buyers, Don’t Get Scammed When Signing!**

Hello, I’m Connor with Honor, your local realtor and former LAPD officer. Today, I want to address something I’ve noticed happening more and more in the real estate world—buyers getting caught off guard by what they’re signing. But before we dive into that, let's cover a crucial aspect of your homeownership that often gets overlooked: **your home’s privacy online.**

### **Protecting Your Home Online**

If you’re like most homeowners, you may not realize that images of your property are still lingering online long after your sale is complete. These pictures are available on Google Maps, Street View, and even on various real estate listing websites. As a former first responder, this concerns me because it gives people—potential criminals—access to information about your home, like entry points, exits, and proximity to neighbors, without even stepping foot in your neighborhood.

If this concerns you too, don’t worry. You can remove these photos and protect your privacy. For step-by-step instructions on how to remove your home’s photos from Google Maps and real estate platforms, check out my previous blog posts and podcast episodes:

Now, let’s get into today’s **Santa Clarita real estate market update** and some key tips for buyers.

### **Santa Clarita Market Snapshot (Past 7 Days)**

Here’s a quick look at the numbers from the past week in the Santa Clarita real estate market:

### **Buyers: Don’t Get Scammed When Signing**

Now, let’s get into something I see way too often: buyers signing documents without fully understanding what they’re agreeing to. Before you even look at your first home, you may be asked to sign a buyer’s contract with your agent. And while this can be standard practice, it’s critical that you understand **every** word of what you’re signing.

Here’s my biggest piece of advice: **Don’t just trust what you’re told—read the contract!** Too many buyers assume that their agent is looking out for them, but you’d be surprised how many people have been misled by vague or unclear contract terms.

#### **Here’s what to watch out for:**

### **The Importance of a Buyer Briefing**

Just like we had roll call in the LAPD to brief us on what to expect on the streets, I hold a **buyer briefing** with all my clients. This briefing is crucial for understanding how the market is behaving, how multiple offers work in a seller’s market, and what strategies will give you the edge.

Right now, we’re in a **seller’s market**, which means homes are moving fast and often receive multiple offers. If you’re a buyer in this environment, you need a different approach than you would in a buyer’s market. That’s what we cover in our buyer briefing: how to act quickly but wisely, and how to avoid getting caught up in a bidding war that could cost you more than you expected.

### **Buyer Beware: Scams Are Out There**

The real estate world can sometimes feel like the Wild West. You’ll come across ads and agents promising everything from "free services" to "top deals" without offering any proof of their claims. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.

With fake agents and misleading offers becoming more common, it’s crucial that you protect yourself.

### **A Final Word on Safety and Privacy**

While most criminals don’t plan their crimes, the fact that your home’s layout or photos are available online can make it easier for someone with bad intentions to target you. Installing security cameras, like a Ring doorbell, can add a valuable layer of protection. But the best protection starts with controlling what’s visible to the public. So take those steps to remove your home’s photos from online platforms.

**I’m Connor with Honor, your real estate expert in Santa Clarita.** My background in law enforcement has taught me how to keep people safe, and I apply that same vigilance to real estate. If you’re buying or selling a home, you can trust that I’ll help you navigate every step of the process with your best interests—and safety—in mind.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
