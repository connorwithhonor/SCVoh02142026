When I tell people that I transitioned from law enforcement to real estate, I often get a mix of surprise and curiosity. But the truth is, my time as a police officer—specifically with the LAPD—equipped me with a set of skills that transfers directly into my work as a realtor. Whether it was in the academy, on patrol, or as a specialized instructor, every piece of training I received as a cop honed my ability to think quickly, act decisively, and handle high-stakes situations.

Now, as I serve my clients in the Santa Clarita Valley, those same principles guide me through every transaction, from first-time buyers looking for a starter home to sellers needing top dollar for their property.

Let me walk you through exactly how the streets of Los Angeles prepared me for the fast-paced world of real estate and how I use that experience to give my clients an edge in one of the most competitive markets around.

### Quick Decision-Making: Patrol Streets vs. Real Estate Market

In law enforcement, every second counts. Whether it’s responding to a call, handling a traffic stop, or making an arrest, hesitation can be the difference between a controlled situation and chaos. You have to assess the environment quickly, gather as much information as possible in seconds, and then make your move.

In real estate, time may not always feel as critical, but don’t be fooled—it can be. The market moves fast, especially in places like Santa Clarita, where inventory can disappear in the blink of an eye. As of October 5th, 2024, we have:

	- **81 new listings** hitting the market this week.

	- **15 listings** coming soon.

	- **67 properties** seeing price changes, most of which are reductions.

	- **31 properties** going under contract.

	- **68 properties** closing.

With numbers like these, buyers and sellers must be ready to act quickly, and that’s where my experience kicks in. I’ve learned to assess situations rapidly, spot opportunities, and make sure my clients are positioned to make their move at the right moment.

### Negotiation Skills: Staring Down a Suspect vs. Navigating Real Estate Deals

In law enforcement, there are moments when you’re face-to-face with someone who doesn’t want to comply. Whether you’re arresting a suspect or handling a volatile situation, you can’t back down. You have to stand your ground, be firm, and make sure that you control the situation.

This is exactly what happens in real estate negotiations. When I’m negotiating on behalf of my clients—whether they’re buyers or sellers—I don’t fold under pressure. I’ve stared down more intimidating situations than a tough negotiator. Just like when you’re toe-to-toe with someone who doesn’t want to go quietly, you hold firm, make your case, and see the situation through to the end.

### Paperwork Precision: Police Reports vs. Real Estate Contracts

In my law enforcement days, if you left out one detail in a report, it could have serious consequences. If an arrest report wasn’t complete, the case could fall apart, and the bad guy could walk free. The paperwork had to be pristine, with every i dotted and t crossed.

Real estate is no different. If you’re making an offer on a house, and your agent misses a key document or leaves out important information, you could lose the deal. Sellers don’t want to deal with sloppy offers. In fact, a seller’s agent might reject your offer outright if it’s incomplete—no second chances. As I often tell my clients, make sure everything is in place from the start, or you risk losing out to someone else who came prepared.

### Patience and Tactics: Stakeouts vs. Waiting for the Right Deal

In law enforcement, especially in long-term investigations, patience is a virtue. I remember stakeouts that could go on for hours, waiting for just the right moment to make a move. You couldn’t rush it, but you also couldn’t let the opportunity slip by.

In real estate, patience is key as well. Whether you’re waiting for a seller to accept an offer or for a buyer to get their finances in order, there are moments when rushing will cost you. I coach my clients to be ready to act when necessary but to hold steady when patience will bring a better outcome. Timing is everything.

### Training and Teaching: LAPD Instructor vs. Educating Real Estate Clients

As an LAPD instructor, I trained other officers in drug recognition, firearms, and various tactical skills. Teaching required not only mastery of the subject but also the ability to communicate it clearly and effectively, ensuring that officers were prepared for anything.

In real estate, I take the same approach with my clients. My job isn’t just to close deals—it’s to educate and guide my clients through every step of the process. I break down complex contracts, explain market trends, and ensure they feel confident in their decisions. Just like I taught officers to stay sharp and prepared, I empower my clients with the knowledge they need to succeed.

### Teamwork and Trust: Partnering with Fellow Officers vs. Collaborating with Clients

In law enforcement, trust is everything. You rely on your fellow officers to have your back, especially in dangerous situations. If that trust breaks down, the whole team is at risk.

In real estate, trust between agent and client is equally important. My clients rely on me to guide them through one of the most significant financial decisions of their lives. I don’t take that responsibility lightly. I’m there for them from the first consultation to closing, ensuring they feel supported, informed, and ready to move forward.

### Conclusion: Why My Law Enforcement Background Makes Me a Better Realtor

So, how does preparing for the streets prepare you to be someone’s real estate agent? It’s simple: the skills that kept me sharp and alive on the streets of Los Angeles are the same skills I bring to the real estate table every day.

	- **Quick thinking and decisive action:** I assess market conditions, client needs, and potential issues quickly, ensuring my clients stay ahead of the curve.

	- **Tough negotiation skills:** I don’t back down when it comes to getting my clients the best deal possible. Whether I’m negotiating on price, contingencies, or closing terms, I hold firm and advocate fiercely.

	- **Precision in paperwork:** Just like in law enforcement, attention to detail matters. A single mistake can cost my clients, and I ensure nothing is left to chance.

	- **Patience and strategy:** In real estate, as in law enforcement, sometimes the best move is to wait for the right opportunity. I help my clients balance patience with decisive action, ensuring they strike when the time is right.

	- **Education and communication:** I’m not just here to close deals—I’m here to educate and empower my clients. I make sure they understand the process and are confident in their decisions every step of the way.

	- **Trust and reliability:** My clients know they can count on me. I’m there for them, just like I was there for my fellow officers. I’ve got their back, and I’ll see them through every challenge that comes our way.

So, if you’re looking for a real estate agent who brings the grit, determination, and discipline of a police officer to the real estate world, you’ve found him. I’m Connor with Honor, and I’m ready to help you navigate the market with confidence and success.

### 1. **Premium Listings Move Quickly**

In areas like **Valencia** and **Stevenson Ranch**, homes in the upper-tier price range (around **$1.3M and above**) are spending surprisingly little time on the market. Many of these homes are going under contract in **16-32 days**, showing strong buyer interest in these high-value properties. For sellers, this means pricing your home competitively in these neighborhoods could result in a quick sale, while buyers need to be prepared to act swiftly when the right home becomes available.

### 2. **Price Reductions Dominate the Market**

Out of the **67 price changes** in the past seven days, the majority are price reductions, especially in areas like **Canyon Country** and **Newhall**. This suggests that sellers in these neighborhoods are becoming more flexible to close deals. For buyers, it presents a golden opportunity to negotiate a better price. Sellers should be prepared to adjust their pricing strategy based on market trends if they want to remain competitive.

### 3. **Condos and Townhomes Gaining Popularity**

Condos and townhomes in areas like **Saugus** and **Canyon Country** are moving fast, often with **multiple offers** within days of hitting the market. Affordable housing options in the $400K-$600K range are becoming highly desirable, especially among first-time homebuyers and investors. Buyers in these price ranges should be prepared for competitive bidding, while sellers can take advantage of this high demand by listing now.

### 4. **New Listings Surge, But Not Enough to Satisfy Demand**

With **81 new listings** coming onto the market this week, the inventory is growing, but it's still tight, especially for single-family residences. Buyers will need to be strategic and decisive, while sellers have a bit of leverage due to the ongoing supply-demand imbalance.

### 5. **Back on Market Properties Offer Second Chances**

About **23 properties** came back on the market after initial deals fell through, offering buyers a second shot at homes they may have missed. Often, these homes have already passed inspections and appraisal, making them a safer bet for buyers looking for a more straightforward closing process.

### 6. **Coming Soon Listings - A First-Mover Advantage**

With **15 coming soon listings**, buyers who keep a close eye on these properties can position themselves for early negotiations. For sellers, this "coming soon" strategy helps build demand even before the property officially hits the market.

### 7. **Contracts Are Moving Quickly**

Of the **31 properties under contract**, many have been on the market for **less than two weeks**, reflecting how swiftly deals are moving. Buyers should be pre-approved and ready to act quickly to secure their dream home. Sellers should make sure their homes are priced correctly and in good showing condition to capitalize on this fast-moving market.

### 8. **Expired and Withdrawn Listings**

Out of **10 expired** listings, many were in the **luxury home** category, indicating that some sellers are still overpricing their properties in hope of finding a buyer. If you’re selling in the high-end market, it’s crucial to set a competitive price. For buyers, it’s an opportunity to revisit homes that may be re-listed at a lower price point soon.

### 9. **Active Inventory Trends**

Despite the uptick in **new listings**, the market remains tight with only **a limited supply of homes for sale**, especially in **single-family residences**. Inventory remains highly competitive, meaning buyers need to be ready to move quickly and sellers are still in a favorable position to negotiate.

These insights demonstrate that the Santa Clarita real estate market is a dynamic one, with fast-moving inventory, price flexibility, and opportunities for both buyers and sellers. Whether you’re looking to buy or sell, staying informed about these trends will give you an advantage.
