## Deep Dive into Market Statuses

In any active real estate market, properties are typically categorized by their current status. Understanding these statuses is key to interpreting market data.

### Active Listings

Active listings represent homes that are currently on the market and available for purchase. The active segment of Santa Clarita’s market has shown considerable resilience despite changing economic conditions. For instance:
