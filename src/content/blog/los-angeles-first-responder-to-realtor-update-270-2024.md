# Los Angeles first responder to realtor update 270-2024 

Connor "with Honor" MacIvor - September 26, 2024** [0 Comments](/#comments) | [Add Comment](/#add-comment)
I feel like Dr. Frankenstein when using the various AI models. Today, Meta seems like the winner. The data field is not large enough to eat all the data with the new open ai mini models, or the full 01 model. I used the big 4 today. ChapGPT 4.0, copilot, gemini and meta.&nbsp; Today Copilot seems to be the overall winner with the data and numbers it crunched from the uploaded csv files. For the graphics - Gemini seems to have won hands down, at least for today.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
