# Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Update – Day 278 of 2024 (October 4, 2024)

Below is today’s **Santa Clarita Market Watch**, with a comparison to the data from **7 days ago**, giving you a clearer sense of how the market is shifting.

### **Current Market Watch Data – October 4, 2024** (Day 278):

### **Comparing with Last Week’s Data (September 27, 2024 – Day 271):**

### **Market Insights:**

Over the past 7 days, the **Santa Clarita real estate market** has seen **subtle shifts**. Notable changes include a **rise in pending transactions** (+7) and a **jump in closed sales** (+13), indicating that the market is still moving briskly. This is a good sign for both buyers and sellers: sellers are closing deals, and more properties are under contract.

However, **new listings** have decreased slightly (-8), indicating tightening inventory, which could result in **higher competition** for buyers. The number of properties **coming soon** has increased (+4), which may lead to more choices for buyers in the near future, while the rise in **price changes** suggests some **sellers are adjusting their expectations** to meet current market demand.

### **What This Means for Buyers and Sellers:**

For **buyers**, this week’s drop in new listings and the increase in pending contracts means that competition is heating up, especially for well-priced homes. Be ready to move quickly if you find a home you love, and work with an agent who can help you **navigate negotiations** and secure the best deal.

For **sellers**, this is a great time to list your property. With fewer new listings and increased buyer activity, your home could stand out even more. Properties that have come back on the market or undergone price changes may indicate that some **sellers are open to negotiations**.

## Why Trust a First Responder Turned Realtor?

Now that you’re up-to-date on the current state of the Santa Clarita real estate market, let’s talk about why hiring a realtor with a **first responder background**—like me—can make all the difference in your real estate transaction.

In 1990, I became a police officer with the **Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)**, serving and protecting the community for over 20 years. By 1998, I experienced firsthand the frustrations of a poorly managed home purchase, which led me to pursue my real estate license. My transition from **law enforcement to real estate** might seem like a leap, but these two fields have a lot more in common than you might think.

### Why Choose a Realtor With a First Responder Background?

When you work with a former **first responder**, you’re getting more than just a typical realtor. Here’s why my background as a police officer gives me a unique edge in helping you with your **real estate needs**:

### 1. **Attention to Detail**

In law enforcement, missing the smallest detail could have serious consequences. This same mindset applies in real estate—where small oversights in contracts, inspections, or negotiations could cost you big. With my **law enforcement training**, I’m able to **scrutinize details** and ensure nothing is missed, whether I’m reviewing offers, marketing your property, or guiding you through a transaction.

### 2. **Handling High-Pressure Situations**

As a police officer, I was trained to stay calm and effective in **high-stress environments**. Buying or selling a home can be one of the most stressful decisions you make, and my experience allows me to remain composed and **focused on your goals**, even when challenges arise. Whether it's negotiating a better price or navigating complicated contingencies, I’m equipped to handle **high-stakes situations** with the same level of focus I applied in law enforcement.

### 3. **Commitment to Service**

As a first responder, my commitment was to the **well-being of my community**. In real estate, my commitment remains the same—I’m here to protect your interests, ensuring you get the best deal and making sure your experience is seamless from start to finish. My mission is not just to **sell you a home** or **help you sell your property**; it’s to provide **exceptional service** that reflects my background in public service.

### 4. **Built on Trust**

Trust is everything in law enforcement, and the same applies to real estate. You need to trust that your realtor is **transparent**, **honest**, and working in your best interest. My reputation in law enforcement was built on **integrity** and **reliability**, and I carry that same mindset into every real estate transaction I handle.

## The Santa Clarita Advantage: Local Expertise Backed by Law Enforcement Experience

The **Santa Clarita Valley** is one of the most desirable regions in **Southern California**, with diverse neighborhoods that offer unique benefits for buyers and sellers. As a local realtor who has been serving this area for years, I know the ins and outs of neighborhoods like **Valencia**, **Saugus**, **Canyon Country**, **Newhall**, **Stevenson Ranch**, and **Castaic**.

This deep local knowledge, combined with my background in law enforcement, allows me to offer **unmatched precision** in handling real estate transactions. Whether you’re looking to buy or sell in **Santa Clarita**, here’s how each of these neighborhoods stands out:

### Valencia: The Family Hub

Valencia is known for its **master-planned communities**, top-rated schools, and family-friendly environment. It’s a great place for families looking to settle down. With home prices starting in the mid-**$700,000s**, the area is attractive for those looking for a balance between community amenities and **convenience**.

Current Listings Include:

### Canyon Country: Affordable and Accessible

Canyon Country offers **affordability** without sacrificing convenience. With easy access to the **14 Freeway**, it’s perfect for commuters. Home prices in this area typically start in the **mid-$400,000s**, making it ideal for first-time buyers or those looking for a more affordable option.

Current Listings Include:

### Saugus: Family-Oriented and Affordable

Saugus is perfect for growing families with its **excellent schools** and community-driven neighborhoods. Homes here typically start around **$600,000**, offering a great balance of price and lifestyle.

Current Listings Include:

## Why Now is a Great Time to List or Buy in Santa Clarita

The real estate market in **Santa Clarita** continues to show **positive growth**. Over the past week, we’ve seen a **slight dip in new listings**, but increased **pending transactions** and **closed sales**, indicating that the market remains **active and competitive**.
