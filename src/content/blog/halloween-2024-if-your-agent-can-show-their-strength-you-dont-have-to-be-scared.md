### **Santa Clarita Real Estate Market: Your Complete 7-Day Snapshot for Smart Buyers and Sellers**

**Good morning, Santa Clarita!**

I'm Connor MacIvor, your First Responder Realtor, here to bring you the facts on our local real estate scene in true Joe Friday style: "Just the facts, ma'am." Every day, I deliver market insights tailored for Santa Clarita residents, focusing on real data, trends, and strategies that benefit buyers and sellers alike. With over 20 years in real estate, my goal is to ensure you're equipped to make smart, well-informed decisions. So, let’s dive into the 7-day snapshot and what it means for your real estate plans.

#### **Market Overview: The 7-Day Snapshot in Santa Clarita**

In the past week, the Santa Clarita housing market has shown some intriguing patterns. Here’s what the data looks like:

This 7-day market history gives a clear view of where the market stands in Santa Clarita and can guide both buyers and sellers to make the right choices in their real estate journey.

### **For Sellers: What This Data Means for You**

If you're considering selling your home, the numbers paint a compelling picture. Here’s the reality:

#### **1. Increased Competition with New Listings**

With 49 new listings this week alone, the competition for buyer attention is heating up. In a market where buyers have options, positioning your home strategically is essential. Each new listing is an alternative to yours, so it’s crucial to stand out.

#### **2. The Price Adjustment Wave**

The 74 price adjustments this week highlight that many sellers are aligning their prices with current market realities. Pricing a property too high can backfire, leading to prolonged listing times or the dreaded “price reduction” later. To avoid ending up in this category, I help my clients price their homes strategically from day one. A realistic price based on current market data attracts serious buyers and avoids the pitfalls of multiple adjustments that might harm buyer perception.

#### **3. Opportunities in “Back on Market” Properties**

Those 17 back-on-market properties? They often represent deals that fell through, possibly due to financing issues or inspection surprises. When a home returns to the market, it can sometimes be a chance to negotiate more effectively, as the seller may be more open to flexibility.

#### **4. Why Expired and Canceled Listings Happen**

With seven expired and six canceled listings, it's clear that some homes are simply not hitting the mark. These numbers reinforce the importance of setting realistic expectations and making sure your home is in peak condition. I work closely with my clients to ensure that every listing is tailored for success, avoiding these pitfalls and setting realistic timelines that lead to closed deals, not disappointments.

#### **Seller Tip:** If you’re ready to list, make sure to leverage this data and partner with an agent who can help your home stand out. From competitive pricing to essential repairs and impactful marketing, every detail matters.

### **For Buyers: Here’s What the Market Snapshot Tells Us**

On the flip side, buyers, there are golden opportunities in this market. Here’s how you can navigate it strategically:

#### **1. New Inventory and Choice**

The **49 new listings** mean fresh options to explore. With each new property that comes onto the market, buyers get more choices to consider. Whether you’re looking for a specific neighborhood, a unique feature, or a particular price range, now’s a great time to explore the new inventory.

#### **2. Advantage in Price Adjustments**

This week’s **74 price changes** indicate that some sellers are showing flexibility. If a property has had a recent price drop, it could signal a motivated seller and a prime opportunity for you to negotiate. My advice? Don’t shy away from making reasonable offers on these homes—they’re often ripe for negotiation, which means added value for you.

#### **3. Seize the “Back on Market” Properties**

Properties that have gone back on the market present a unique advantage. Often, these homes fell out of contract due to buyer financing issues or specific inspection findings. With 17 such properties back in the running, you have the chance to jump in, often with more negotiating power if the seller is looking to avoid another delay.

#### **4. Act on Well-Priced Listings**

The **32 active under contract** and **38 pending properties** show that well-priced homes don’t last. Santa Clarita’s market is active, and the right property at the right price will attract offers fast. Timing is crucial here—if you find a property that fits your needs and is priced fairly, be prepared to act swiftly to secure it before it’s off the table.

#### **Buyer Tip:** Work with an agent who knows how to spot the best opportunities in this competitive market. Price adjustments, back-on-market properties, and fresh inventory are all potential gold mines if you’re ready to move decisively.

### **Negotiation and Strategy Tips for Both Buyers and Sellers**

Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, the art of negotiation is where deals are won or lost. Here’s how I approach negotiations with an emphasis on facts and strategy:

#### **1. Focus on the Essentials**

Not every buyer request is necessary, and not every seller concession is wise. I advise my sellers to focus on requests that genuinely impact the property’s value. For buyers, I recommend only negotiating on items that matter long-term. The market has shown me that getting “the one” sometimes means focusing on essentials and avoiding unnecessary conflicts over minor details.

#### **2. Show, Don’t Just Tell**

I’ve found that in-person requests during negotiations make a stronger case than a simple email. When a repair is needed or a price adjustment is justified, showing up with supporting data, inspection results, or specific market comparisons can make all the difference. Whether it’s a leaking pipe or a structural concern, I provide buyers and sellers with the context they need to understand the value of the adjustment.

#### **3. Data-Driven Negotiations**

Numbers tell a powerful story. Using this 7-day snapshot data, I can showcase the importance of a competitive offer or explain why a price adjustment is warranted. This approach makes both parties feel confident in the fairness of the deal and reduces emotional friction.

#### **4. Leverage Market Trends**

Knowing that **price adjustments** and **back-on-market listings** are prevalent, I use these trends to create a strong negotiation position. For sellers, I leverage these trends to justify firm pricing, and for buyers, they serve as a tool to secure fair concessions.

### **Why Santa Clarita is a Strong Real Estate Market Right Now**

Santa Clarita remains an appealing area for homebuyers for a host of reasons. Here’s why the market here continues to show strong activity despite changing economic landscapes:
