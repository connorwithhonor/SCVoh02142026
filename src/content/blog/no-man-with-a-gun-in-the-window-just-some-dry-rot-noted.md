**Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Watch: A 7-Day Snapshot and Strategic Guidance for Sellers and Buyers**

**Day 288 of 2024 (October 14, 2024)**

Welcome to another update of the **Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Watch**! I'm **Connor with Honor**, your **First Responder Realtor**, here to deliver a comprehensive breakdown of the past 7 days in the market, along with some valuable insights for both sellers and buyers. Drawing from years of service as a first responder, I bring the same discipline, preparation, and commitment to defending your real estate interests as I did protecting the public.

Let’s dive into today’s numbers and what they mean for you.

### **7-Day Snapshot of the Santa Clarita Market**

Here’s how the Santa Clarita market has performed over the past week:

These numbers provide a snapshot of the **Santa Clarita real estate market**, and as we move deeper into the fall season, we continue to see competitive pricing, active buying, and tight inventory levels. Let’s break down what this means for **sellers** and **buyers**.

### **Seller Strategy: Preparation is Key**

If you’re a seller, pricing your home right from the start is as critical as responding to an emergency call in law enforcement—time is of the essence. With **68 price changes** in the last 7 days, we’re seeing sellers adjusting their expectations to align with current market conditions. The competition is tight, and **buyers are savvy**—they know how to spot value.

#### **Pro Tip for Sellers:**

### **Buyer Strategy: Be Ready to Move Fast**

For buyers, the market is competitive, and the best properties can move fast—sometimes within hours of hitting the market or even before during the “coming soon” phase. If you’re serious about buying, being ready to act decisively is crucial.

#### **Pro Tip for Buyers:**

### **The Back on Market Phenomenon: Opportunity or Red Flag?**

With **27 properties coming back on the market**, there’s a lot to consider. A home falling out of escrow could indicate an issue, but it also presents a new opportunity for buyers to negotiate. Often, deals fall through due to financing, inspections, or unexpected changes in buyer circumstances. If you’re prepared, a **back on market** property can be an excellent way to secure a home that had interest but hit a temporary roadblock.

#### **Pro Tip for Sellers and Buyers:**

### **Market Health: Active But Competitive**

The Santa Clarita market remains **active**, with both buyers and sellers adjusting to market conditions. While the number of **coming soon** listings remains low at **11**, there are plenty of new opportunities with **79 fresh listings** and a consistent number of **pending** and **closed** transactions. As always, navigating this landscape with the right strategy is essential for success.

As a **First Responder Realtor**, I bring the same level of thorough preparation and commitment to my clients as I did when serving the public. Real estate is no different from a high-stakes operation—planning, precision, and execution matter. Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, having a trusted professional by your side is critical to making the best decisions in today’s market.

### **Closing Thoughts**

Whether you're looking to buy or sell, the Santa Clarita market continues to present opportunities, but you need to act quickly and strategically. If you have any questions or need help navigating the process, don’t hesitate to reach out to me at **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com**. I’ve been **defending your real estate interests** with the same dedication I defended the public’s trust since 1990.

**Stay safe, stay informed**, and as always, I’ll be back tomorrow with another update.

**Connor with Honor**, **First Responder Realtor**—**Over and Out**.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
