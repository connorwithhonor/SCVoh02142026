**Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Watch: A 7-Day Snapshot and Strategic Guidance for Sellers and Buyers**

**Day 288 of 2024 (October 14, 2024)**

Welcome to another update of the **Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Watch**! I'm **Connor with Honor**, your **First Responder Realtor**, here to deliver a comprehensive breakdown of the past 7 days in the market, along with some valuable insights for both sellers and buyers. Drawing from years of service as a first responder, I bring the same discipline, preparation, and commitment to defending your real estate interests as I did protecting the public.

Let’s dive into today’s numbers and what they mean for you.

### **7-Day Snapshot of the Santa Clarita Market**

Here’s how the Santa Clarita market has performed over the past week:

	- **Coming Soon**: 11 properties

	- **New Listings**: 79 fresh on the market

	- **Price Changes**: 68 adjustments

	- **Back on Market**: 27 properties that returned to the market after falling out of escrow

	- **Active Under Contract**: 29 homes nearing the final stages of closing

	- **Pending**: 46 properties working their way through the escrow process

	- **Closed**: 59 properties successfully sold

	- **Expired**: 4 listings that didn’t sell during their listing period

	- **Canceled**: 16 listings pulled from the market

	- **Hold**: 10 properties temporarily off-market

	- **Withdrawn**: 3 listings withdrawn from the market altogether

These numbers provide a snapshot of the **Santa Clarita real estate market**, and as we move deeper into the fall season, we continue to see competitive pricing, active buying, and tight inventory levels. Let’s break down what this means for **sellers** and **buyers**.

### **Seller Strategy: Preparation is Key**

If you’re a seller, pricing your home right from the start is as critical as responding to an emergency call in law enforcement—time is of the essence. With **68 price changes** in the last 7 days, we’re seeing sellers adjusting their expectations to align with current market conditions. The competition is tight, and **buyers are savvy**—they know how to spot value.

#### **Pro Tip for Sellers:**

	- **Price Smart from the Start**: Just like I used to assess situations quickly in the field, pricing your home correctly is a make-or-break moment. If your price is too high, you’ll be overlooked by buyers who are well aware of the neighborhood comps. Don’t let your home become an “expired” listing because it sat on the market too long without a price adjustment.

	- **Pre-Inspections Save Time**: Think of it like clearing a building before entering. Having a pre-inspection done on your property can prevent last-minute surprises during escrow. Buyers appreciate knowing what they’re walking into, and pre-inspections build trust.

	- **Staging Matters**: Walk through your home as if you’re prepping a tactical entry. Identify things that could detract from the appeal—cluttered spaces, over-large furniture, or unnecessary decor. Maximize your counter space and floor space. A pro tip we offer is to **store oversized furniture** in the garage if it makes the room feel cramped. Buyers need to envision the space working for them, not fighting with it.

### **Buyer Strategy: Be Ready to Move Fast**

For buyers, the market is competitive, and the best properties can move fast—sometimes within hours of hitting the market or even before during the “coming soon” phase. If you’re serious about buying, being ready to act decisively is crucial.

#### **Pro Tip for Buyers:**

	- **Get Pre-Approved**: Just like prepping for an urgent call, having your financials in place—like a **mortgage pre-approval**—allows you to move quickly when the right property comes along.

	- **Don’t Wait for the Weekend**: With **79 new listings** in the past 7 days, it's easy to think you'll check out properties later, but with homes moving into **pending** status quickly, you might miss out. When you see something you like, act fast. Sometimes, homes are snapped up before the public even sees them.

	- **Follow Up**: Make sure your agent is following up with the listing agent to express your interest. It’s similar to the coordination we did between officers on the field—it’s crucial to know where you stand and to stay ahead of the competition.

### **The Back on Market Phenomenon: Opportunity or Red Flag?**

With **27 properties coming back on the market**, there’s a lot to consider. A home falling out of escrow could indicate an issue, but it also presents a new opportunity for buyers to negotiate. Often, deals fall through due to financing, inspections, or unexpected changes in buyer circumstances. If you’re prepared, a **back on market** property can be an excellent way to secure a home that had interest but hit a temporary roadblock.

#### **Pro Tip for Sellers and Buyers:**

	- **Sellers**: If your home has fallen out of escrow, this is your chance to address whatever issue caused the fallout. Tighten up any loose ends and be prepared for the next offer.

	- **Buyers**: Don’t be scared off by back-on-market properties. Use this as an opportunity to ask your agent about what happened and potentially negotiate a better deal.

### **Market Health: Active But Competitive**

The Santa Clarita market remains **active**, with both buyers and sellers adjusting to market conditions. While the number of **coming soon** listings remains low at **11**, there are plenty of new opportunities with **79 fresh listings** and a consistent number of **pending** and **closed** transactions. As always, navigating this landscape with the right strategy is essential for success.

As a **First Responder Realtor**, I bring the same level of thorough preparation and commitment to my clients as I did when serving the public. Real estate is no different from a high-stakes operation—planning, precision, and execution matter. Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, having a trusted professional by your side is critical to making the best decisions in today’s market.

### **Closing Thoughts**

Whether you're looking to buy or sell, the Santa Clarita market continues to present opportunities, but you need to act quickly and strategically. If you have any questions or need help navigating the process, don’t hesitate to reach out to me at **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com**. I’ve been **defending your real estate interests** with the same dedication I defended the public’s trust since 1990.

**Stay safe, stay informed**, and as always, I’ll be back tomorrow with another update.

**Connor with Honor**, **First Responder Realtor**—**Over and Out**.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
