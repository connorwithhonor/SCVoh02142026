## Santa Clarita Market: A Closer Look at July 2025

The Santa Clarita real estate market is in a fascinating spot as of July 15, 2025. With a total inventory of 795 listings, we’re down 11 from yesterday’s 806 but up significantly from last month’s mid-700s, when we were hovering around 750. This growth in inventory means more choices for buyers, but the 80 homes sold in the past seven days show that competition is still fierce. As a former first responder, I’ve seen high-pressure situations, and I’m here to guide you through this fast-moving market with clear, actionable insights. Let’s break down the key numbers shaping Santa Clarita’s housing scene.

### Local Market Breakdown

	- 
	**Total Active Listings**: 795, a slight drop from yesterday but a healthy increase from last month, giving buyers more options across neighborhoods like Valencia, Saugus, and Canyon Country.

	

	- 
	**Coming Soon Listings**: 19 properties are in the “coming soon” phase, a goldmine for proactive buyers and sellers looking to gauge neighborhood trends. These listings aren’t on syndication sites like Zillow or Redfin, so you need a connected agent to access them. Sign up for exclusive updates at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/comingsoon.

	

	- 
	**New Listings**: 99 fresh properties hit the market, from cozy condos in Newhall to spacious homes in Castaic.

	

	- 
	**Price Changes**: 119 properties saw price adjustments, reflecting sellers adapting to buyer demand. Track the latest trends at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/santa-clarita-market-report.

	

	- 
	**Back on Market**: 33 properties returned after falling out of escrow, often due to financing or inspection issues, creating second-chance opportunities for buyers.

	

	- 
	**Active Under Contract**: 34 properties are in early escrow, with 49 in pending status, likely to close soon.

	

	- 
	**Sold**: 80 homes closed in the past week, a strong indicator of buyer demand.

	

	- 
	**Other Statuses**: 6 listings expired, 22 were canceled, 11 are on hold, and 4 were withdrawn, rounding out the market’s activity.

	

These numbers tell a story of a market in transition. Buyers have more choices, but sellers need to price strategically to stand out. Let’s see how Santa Clarita’s trends fit into the bigger California and national picture.

## California Real Estate: Cooling Trends and Affordability Challenges

California’s housing market is showing signs of cooling as we move through 2025, influenced by economic factors and environmental challenges. The median home price is projected to hit $900,400, up 4.6% from 2024, but this growth is slowing compared to previous years. Home sales are up slightly year-over-year but dipped in May, hinting at affordability issues and market fatigue. Here’s how these statewide trends impact Santa Clarita.

### Key California Insights

	- 
	**Median Home Price**: The projected $900,400 median price reflects a 4.6% increase, but slower growth suggests a cooling market, especially in Southern California areas like San Diego and Los Angeles, impacted by January 2025 wildfires.

	

	- 
	**Inventory Surge**: Active listings across California have jumped 50% compared to two years ago, mirroring Santa Clarita’s rising inventory. This means longer days on market in areas like Bakersfield and Delano.

	

	- 
	**Price Declines**: List prices dropped 1% this spring compared to 2023, giving buyers some leverage but not enough to ease affordability concerns.

	

	- 
	**Affordability Crisis**: Only 16% of California households can afford a median-priced home, making financing strategies critical. Explore loan options at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/items-you-need-when-applying-for-a-loan.

	

	- 
	**Commercial Trends**: In Los Angeles, industrial and multifamily sectors are thriving, but office spaces face high vacancies, affecting local investment dynamics.

	

	- 
	**Wildfire Impact**: The January 2025 wildfires have led to struggles with the California FAIR Plan, with some homeowners facing denied or undervalued claims. The Small Business Administration extended low-interest loan deadlines to May 30, 2025, for affected residents, offering relief for those rebuilding or relocating.

	

Santa Clarita’s market reflects these statewide trends, with increased inventory and price adjustments creating opportunities for buyers and challenges for sellers. Understanding these dynamics is key to making informed decisions.

## National and Global Real Estate Context

The broader U.S. and global real estate markets provide context for Santa Clarita’s trends. Nationally, mortgage rates are climbing, with forecasts predicting rates around 6.5% by the end of 2025, potentially higher if tariffs drive inflation. This could increase monthly payments for Santa Clarita buyers, especially with the state’s high median home price. Globally, markets like China are seeing home prices drop at the fastest rate in eight months, sparking calls for stimulus, while Canada anticipates small declines in home sales and prices, particularly in British Columbia and Ontario.

In the U.S., affordable homes under $350,000 are still available in areas like New Jersey’s Atlantic, Warren, and Cape May counties, but Santa Clarita’s market aligns more closely with California’s pricier trends. Innovations like LA Rosa Holdings’ AI-powered bot for real estate agent recruiting highlight technology’s growing role, but human expertise remains critical.

## How Buyers Can Win in Santa Clarita’s Market

For buyers, Santa Clarita’s 795 listings and 99 new properties offer a wealth of choices, from gated homes in Stevenson Ranch to condos in Porter Ranch. The 33 back-on-market properties suggest deals are falling through, creating opportunities for those ready to act. With 80 homes sold in a week, speed and preparation are essential. Here’s how to position yourself for success.

### Buyer Strategies

	- 
	**Leverage Coming Soon Listings**: The 19 coming soon listings are exclusive opportunities not found on syndication sites. Work with me to get email updates and potential previews at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/comingsoon.

	

	- 
	**Get Pre-Approved**: A pre-approval strengthens your offer in a competitive market. Learn the process at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/getting-a-legitimate-lender-and-getting-pre-approved.

	

	- 
	**Understand Buyer Agreements**: California’s 2024 mandate requires written agreements to view homes. Get the details at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/why-buyers-need-written-agreements-by-the-first-responder-realtor.

	

	- 
	**Protect Your Credit**: Avoid major purchases before closing to maintain your loan eligibility. See SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/why-you-should-not-make-any-major-credit-purchases.

	

	- 
	**Target Your Neighborhood**: Whether you’re looking for homes with pools in Valencia or new construction in Canyon Country, I can help you find the perfect fit.

## How Sellers Can Stand Out in Santa Clarita

Sellers in Santa Clarita are navigating a competitive market with 119 price changes and 33 properties back on market, but the 80 sales in a week show strong buyer interest.

Here’s how to succeed.

## Affordability and Financing in a High-Rate Environment

California’s $900,400 median home price and 16% household affordability rate highlight the importance of smart financing, especially with U.S. mortgage rates climbing toward 6.5%. For a $900,000 mortgage at 6.5% over 30 years, you’re looking at a monthly payment of about $5,686 (excluding taxes and insurance). At a 5% rate, the same loan would cost $4,830—a difference of over $850 per month. In Santa Clarita, where prices align with state trends, these numbers underscore the need for careful planning.

### Financing Tips

	- 
	**Explore Loan Types**: From fixed-rate to adjustable-rate mortgages, find the best fit for your budget. Visit SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/the-advantages-of-different-types-of-mortgage-lenders.

	

	- 
	**Boost Your FICO Score**: A strong credit score can secure better rates. Learn how at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/whats-a-fico.

	

	- 
	**Consider Creative Financing**: Options like seller concessions or down payment assistance can ease affordability challenges. Explore strategies at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/creative-financing.

	

	- 
	**Get Pre-Approved Early**: A pre-approval strengthens your offer and clarifies your budget. See SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/getting-a-legitimate-lender-and-getting-pre-approved.

	

With rates rising, acting quickly and working with a knowledgeable realtor like me can help you secure the best terms.

## Wildfires and Economic Factors Impacting the Market

The January 2025 wildfires in Southern California, including areas near Santa Clarita, have created challenges for some homeowners, particularly with the California FAIR Plan. Denied or undervalued claims are causing financial strain, but the Small Business Administration’s low-interest loan extension to May 30, 2025, offers relief for those affected. If you’re navigating wildfire-related issues, I can connect you with resources to support your real estate goals.

Nationally, potential tariff-driven inflation could push mortgage rates higher, impacting Santa Clarita’s affordability. Staying informed and working with a local expert ensures you’re prepared for these economic shifts.
