The Top 30 Questions Santa Clarita Home Buyers Are Asking in November 2025 (And the Honest Answers You Won’t Hear Elsewhere) **Author:** Connor MacIvor (Connor with Honor) **Date:** November 12, 2025 **Word Count:** 5,200+

### **Introduction: The "Connor with Honor" Mission**

*Note to Reader: This isn't your standard, fluffy real estate blog. I’m writing this as a retired LAPD officer, a fitness enthusiast who dropped 135 pounds, and a real estate veteran since 1998. My job isn’t just to sell you a house; it’s to protect you. The market in late 2025 is tricky. We have new laws, shifting interest rates, and local infrastructure projects that change the game. Below are the 30 hardest questions buyers are asking me right now, answered with the same transparency I used to bring to the street.*

*(Video Intro Concept: Me standing in front of the new Vista Canyon Multi-Modal Center or a construction site on I-5, wearing my "Honor" branded gear. "Welcome back to the channel. I’m Connor with Honor. Today, we are cutting through the noise. No sales pitch, just the tactical intel you need to survive this market.")*

### **Category 1: Market Strategy &amp; Timing (The "Big Picture")**

#### **1. "Connor, be honest—is November 2025 actually a good time to buy, or should I wait for 2026?"**

**The Honest Truth:** November is traditionally a "sleeper" month, but 2025 is different. Here is the intel: Inventory levels in Santa Clarita have ticked up slightly compared to last year, but we are still in a supply-constrained market. Sellers who list in November—right before the holidays—are *motivated*. They aren't testing the market; they usually have a life event forcing the sale.

**The Data:** We are seeing median prices hold steady around $795,000. If you wait until Spring 2026, forecasts from the California Association of Realtors predict a 3.6% price increase. You might save 0.25% on a rate, but you'll pay $30,000 more for the house. That’s bad math.

**Connor’s Advice:** Be the contrarian. While other buyers are distracted by Thanksgiving and Christmas shopping, you and I will be hunting. We can often negotiate better terms (credits for closing costs) now than we will be able to in March.

**Video Script Hook:** "Everyone tells you to wait for spring. I’m telling you that 'waiting' is the most expensive hobby you can have. Let’s talk about why buying in the 'holiday lull' is your secret weapon."

#### **2. "I keep hearing the Fed cut rates, but mortgage rates are still in the 6s. Why aren’t they lower?"**

**The Explanation:** This is the biggest misconception I deal with. The Federal Reserve cuts the *Federal Funds Rate* (short-term money for banks). Mortgage rates, however, follow the **10-Year Treasury Yield**. The mortgage market has already "priced in" the Fed's moves.

**The Reality Check:** We are currently sitting in the low 6% range (approx. 6.12% for a 30-year fixed as of this week). Why? Because the economy is resilient. Inflation is stubborn. Lenders are hedging their risk.

**Connor’s Strategy:** "Marry the house, date the rate." If the numbers make sense today, buy the home. We can refinance you into a 5% rate later if they drop. But you cannot refinance the purchase price. Once you lock in a price of $800k, that’s yours forever. If you wait for rates to drop, that same house costs $850k.

#### **3. "Should I wait for interest rates to drop back to 4% or 5%?"**

**The Hard Truth:** We may not see 4% again for a decade. The "normal" rate for the last 50 years is closer to 7%. The 3% rates of 2020/2021 were an anomaly caused by a global pandemic. Do not base your financial future on a once-in-a-lifetime crisis event.

**The Risk:** If rates drop to 5% in 2026, buyer demand will explode. That creates bidding wars. You will be competing against 15 other offers. I would rather you buy now with less competition and refinance later, than fight a bidding war next year.

**Video Script Hook:** "Are you waiting for a unicorn? 3% rates are gone. Let’s deal with reality so you can build wealth, not just wait on the sidelines."

#### **4. "Are home prices going to crash in 2026?"**

**The Analysis:** No. I track the local Santa Clarita data daily. A "crash" requires two things: a massive surplus of inventory and a flood of distressed sellers (foreclosures). We have neither.

	- 
	**Inventory:** Still historically low.

	

	- 
	**Equity:** Most homeowners in SCV have massive equity. They aren't walking away from their homes; they are "locked in" to their low rates.

	

**The Forecast:** We are looking at "normalization," not a crash. Prices will likely appreciate at a boring, steady 3-4%. That is healthy. That is safe.

#### **5. "Is it better to buy a new construction home right now?"**

**The "Inside Scoop":** Yes, if you know where to look. Builders like Tri Pointe Homes (Luna at Skyline) or Williams Homes are terrified of carrying inventory past December 31st for tax reasons.

**The Incentives:** Right now, in Q4 2025, builders are offering aggressive rate buydowns—sometimes into the mid-5% range—and covering $10k-$20k in closing costs. A regular seller can't compete with that.

**Connor’s Warning:** New construction has higher taxes (Mello-Roos). We need to run the *full* math. A cheaper rate doesn't help if your tax bill is $400/month higher.

### **Category 2: Financial Fitness (Rates, Payments &amp; The "Hidden" Stuff)**

#### **6. "What is a '2-1 Buydown' and is it a gimmick?"**

**The Mechanics:** It’s a seller-paid concession. The seller puts money into an escrow account to subsidize your interest rate for two years.

	- 
	**Year 1:** Your rate is 2% lower (e.g., 4.25%).

	

	- 
	**Year 2:** Your rate is 1% lower (e.g., 5.25%).

	

	- 
	**Year 3:** It settles at the note rate (e.g., 6.25%).

	

**Connor’s Take:** It is **not** a gimmick, but it is a crutch. I only recommend this if you can qualify for the *full* rate comfortably. Use the savings in the first two years to pay down principal or build your emergency fund. Do not use it to buy a house you can't afford.

#### **7. "How much cash do I *actually* need to close? I don't want surprises."**

**The Breakdown:** Beyond your down payment (3.5% for FHA, 3-20% for Conventional), you need to budget for **Closing Costs**. In Santa Clarita, these run about 2% to 3% of the purchase price.

	- 
	**Escrow Fees:** Split 50/50 usually.

	

	- 
	**Title Insurance:** Owner's policy usually paid by seller in SoCal, but lender's policy is on you.

	

	- 
	**Pre-paids:** Property taxes and insurance paid in advance.

	

**The "SWAN" Fund:** I tell my clients to have a **SWAN** fund—**S**leep **W**ell **A**t **N**ight. Do not spend your last dime at the closing table. You need $5,000-$10,000 left over for when the water heater breaks or you need to paint a nursery.

**Video Script Hook:** "The down payment is just the cover charge. Let's talk about the drink minimum. Here is exactly what cash you need to close."

#### **8. "Can I still buy with just 3.5% or 5% down in this market?"**

**The Answer:** Absolutely. The "20% down" myth stops too many good people from buying.

	- 
	**FHA:** 3.5% down. Limit for LA County in 2025 is **$1,209,750**. That covers almost everything in SCV.

	

	- 
	**Conventional:** First-time buyers can do 3% or 5%.

	

**The Strategy:** You will pay PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance), but think of PMI as the cost of entering the game early. If homes appreciate 4% this year, that gain outweighs the cost of PMI.

#### **9. "What are the hidden costs of owning a home in Santa Clarita specifically?"**

**The Local Intel:**

	- 
	**Mello-Roos:** Special tax assessments in newer areas like Skyline, Five Knolls, or West Creek. These can add $150 to $500 per month to your payment. We check the tax bill *before* we offer.

	

	- 
	**HOA Fees:** They are rising. Insurance for condo complexes has doubled, so HOAs are passing that cost to you.

	

	- 
	**Supplemental Taxes:** The county takes 6 months to catch up to your new purchase price. You will get a surprise bill in the mail for the difference. I warn you now so you can save for it.

	

#### **10. "Does my credit score need to be perfect?"**

**The Fitness Analogy:** No, just like you don't need 5% body fat to be healthy. You can buy with a 580 (FHA), but you pay a penalty in the rate.

	- 
	**Target:** 740+ gets you the "Gold Standard" rates.

	

	- 
	**The Fix:** If you are at 680, my lender can run a "What-If" simulator. Sometimes paying down one credit card by $500 can bump you 20 points. We do the work *before* we apply.

	

### **Category 3: Tactical Negotiations (The "Honor" Approach)**

#### **11. "Can we negotiate the asking price right now?"**

**The Strategy:** Yes. If a home has been on the market &gt;21 days in November 2025, that seller is sweating.

	- 
	**The Move:** We don't just lowball. We offer a fair price but ask for a **$10,000 credit** towards your closing costs or rate buydown.

	

	- 
	**Why:** A $10k price reduction saves you $60/month. A $10k rate buydown can save you $400/month. We negotiate for *payment*, not just price.

	

#### **12. "Should I waive the home inspection to be competitive?"**

**Connor’s Rule:** **NEVER.** Not on my watch. I spent 20 years investigating; I don't stop now. Waiving an inspection is gambling. We can shorten the timeline (e.g., 7 days to inspect instead of 17) to show we are serious, but we never waive the right to know if the foundation is cracking.

#### **13. "What is a 'contingency' and which ones should I keep?"**

**The Definition:** A contingency is your "Get Out of Jail Free" card.

	- 
	**Inspection:** "I buy if the house isn't falling apart."

	

	- 
	**Appraisal:** "I buy if the bank says it's worth the price."

	

	- 
	**Loan:** "I buy if the lender gives me the money."

	

**The Strategy:** In this market, we keep all three. If we are in a multiple-offer situation on a dream home, we might tighten the *Loan* contingency if we have a solid Underwriter Approval (not just pre-qual), but we protect your deposit first.

#### **14. "How much earnest money deposit (EMD) should I put down?"**

**The Standard:** Usually 3% of the purchase price in California.

	- 
	**Example:** On an $800k home, that’s $24,000.

	

	- 
	**Safety:** This money sits in Escrow, a neutral third party. The seller doesn't touch it. If we cancel due to a valid contingency (like a bad inspection), you get it back. I ensure that paperwork is bulletproof.

	

#### **15. "The seller is asking for a 'Rent Back.' What is that?"**

**The Situation:** The seller sells to you, closes escrow, but stays in the house for up to 29 or 59 days to pack and move.

	- 
	**The Risk:** You are now a landlord.

	

	- 
	**The Protection:** We hold back a deposit (e.g., $5,000) in escrow to ensure they move out on time and don't leave trash behind. We use a distinct form (SIP or RLAS) to protect you legally.

	

### **Category 4: New Laws &amp; The "Honor" Difference**

#### **16. "What is this new 'Buyer-Broker Agreement' I have to sign? (AB 2992)"**

**The Law Change:** As of January 1, 2025, California law (AB 2992) requires us to have a written agreement *before* I can even show you a home.

	- 
	**The Good News:** It increases transparency. You know exactly what I get paid and what I do for you.

	

	- 
	**The Limit:** These agreements are now limited to **3 months**. This keeps me accountable. If I don't perform, you fire me in 90 days. I love this because I earn my keep every day.

	

**Video Script Hook:** "Why do you have to sign a contract just to see a house? It’s the new law, and honestly, it’s a good thing. Here is why."

#### **17. "Who pays your commission now? Do I have to pay it?"**

**The Reality:** Historically, sellers paid everything. Now, it's negotiable.

	- 
	**Most Common:** Sellers still pay the buyer's agent commission because they want their home sold. It comes out of their proceeds.

	

	- 
	**If They Don't:** We write it into the offer. "Offer Price: $800k, Seller to credit Buyer X% for Agent Commission."

	

	- 
	**My Promise:** I will never let commission stand in the way of you getting the right home. We will figure out the math so you aren't coming out of pocket unexpectedly.

	

### **Category 5: Safety, Location &amp; Lifestyle (The "First Responder" Perspective)**

#### **18. "How do I *really* check the safety of a neighborhood?"**

**Connor’s "Beat Cop" Method:** Online crime maps are delayed. Here is what you do:

	- 
	**Drive it at 9 PM on a Friday.** Are the garages open? Are people walking dogs? That shows comfort.

	

	- 
	**Look for "Pride of Ownership."** manicured lawns, no trash cans left out. This means neighbors care and watch out for each other.

	

	- 
	**Ask Me:** I can look up calls-for-service density. There's a difference between "noisy party" calls and "grand theft auto" calls.

	

#### **19. "Is buying a home with a pool worth the extra maintenance cost?"**

**The Lifestyle Audit:**

	- 
	**Financial:** You generally do *not* get dollar-for-dollar value back on resale.

	

	- 
	**Cost:** Pool service in SCV is now $160-$200/month. Plus higher electric/gas bills for the pump and heater.

	

	- 
	**Verdict:** If you have kids or are focused on fitness (like I am—swimming is great cardio), it's worth it for the *lifestyle*. Just budget an extra $300/month for "pool inflation."

	

#### **20. "What’s the deal with solar panels? Do I have to take over the lease?"**

**The Deal Killer:** Solar leases are the #1 friction point in 2025.

	- 
	**Leased:** You have to qualify for the solar payment *on top* of your mortgage. It's a debt.

	

	- 
	**PPA (Power Purchase Agreement):** Even trickier.

	

	- 
	**Owned:** Gold mine. You get free electricity.

	

	- 
	**My Job:** I demand the solar contract immediately. If the terms are bad, we ask the seller to pay it off or we walk.

	

#### **21. "Should I worry about fire insurance in Santa Clarita?"**

**The Crisis:** Yes. Following the fires in recent years, many major carriers have paused writing new policies in "High Fire Zones" (like parts of Canyon Country or Stevenson Ranch).

	- 
	**The Fix:** We check the **California FAIR Plan** maps immediately.

	

	- 
	**New Help:** The new AB 888 law helps with grants for fireproofing, but we need to know if the house is insurable *before* you fall in love. I have insurance brokers on speed dial who specialize in difficult-to-insure homes.

	

#### **22. "How are the schools rating now? Has anything changed?"**

**The "Boots on the Ground" View:** Online ratings (GreatSchools) are fine, but they lag.

	- 
	**My Advice:** Go to the front office. How does the staff treat you? Look at the parents picking up kids. That vibe tells you more than a test score.

	

	- 
	**SCV Status:** We are still one of the top districts in the state, but specific boundaries shift. I have the latest boundary maps to ensure the house you buy actually feeds into the high school you want.

	

### **Category 6: Future-Proofing &amp; Tech (AI &amp; Commutes)**

#### **23. "Will AI change how I sell this house in 5-10 years?"**

**The Future is Now:** Absolutely. By the time you sell, AI tools like **Restb.ai** (computer vision) will likely assess your home's condition instantly from photos.

	- 
	**Your Job:** Keep digital records. When you replace the HVAC or roof, scan the receipt. We are moving toward a "Carfax for Homes."

	

	- 
	**My Role:** I use AI tools *now* to market homes (using things like **Honor Elevate** systems) to find buyers who aren't even looking on Zillow yet.

	

**Video Script Hook:** "AI isn't just for writing emails. It's changing how your home is valued. Here is how to 'future-proof' your home's value starting today."

#### **24. "Is the commute to LA still a nightmare, or is it getting better?"**

**The Infrastructure Update:**

	- 
	**I-5 Enhancements:** The North County Enhancements project (adding HOV and truck lanes) is active. You’ve seen the construction near Lyons Ave/Pico Canyon. It’s messy *now* (late 2025), but scheduled for completion in 2026. It will help.

	

	- 
	**Metrolink:** The "Canyon Siding Extension" is reducing wait times, and the new **Vista Canyon Multi-Modal Center** is a game changer for commuters on the east side.

	

	- 
	**Ticket Whisperer Tip:** Use the Waze "Planned Drive" feature. Traffic patterns have shifted; Tuesdays/Thursdays are the new "peak" days due to hybrid work schedules.

	

#### **25. "Is this home 'smart' enough? What tech should I look for?"**

**The "Bones" vs. "Gadgets":** Don't pay extra for smart bulbs. Look for infrastructure.

	- 
	**Essential:** Cat6 wiring in the walls.

	

	- 
	**EV Ready:** Is there a 220v outlet in the garage? If not, budget $1,000 to install one.

	

	- 
	**Fiber:** Does the street have high-speed fiber capability?

	

	- 
	**Why:** Gadgets become obsolete; wiring adds value.

	

### **Category 7: Logistics &amp; The "Connor" Process**

#### **26. "How long does the whole process take right now?"**

**The Timeline:**

	- 
	**Search:** 2 weeks to 2 months. Don't rush.

	

	- 
	**Escrow:** 30 days is standard.

	

	- 
	**Total:** Expect about 60-90 days from "Let's start" to "Here are your keys."

	

	- 
	**Delay Factors:** The holidays (Thanksgiving/Christmas) slow things down slightly as loan officers and escrow officers take time off. We plan for that.

	

#### **27. "Can I buy a house if I have to sell mine first?"**

**The "Contingent Sale":** Yes. It’s a domino game.

	- 
	**The Trick:** We have to get your home "Under Contract" *before* we make offers on the new one. Sellers in November 2025 are more open to this than they were two years ago because they need buyers.

	

	- 
	**My Role:** I manage both transactions so the dates line up perfectly. I’m the "Traffic Controller" for your move.

	

#### **28. "What happens at the final walkthrough?"**

**The Final Inspection:** We go back 5 days before closing.

	- 
	**Checklist:** Did they fix the repairs we negotiated? (I want receipts). Did the movers put a hole in the wall? Is the stove still there?

	

	- 
	**The Connor Standard:** I bring a circuit tester and run the water in every sink. We don't sign until it's right.

	

#### **29. "Why should I hire you specifically, Connor?"**

**The Pitch:** Because I don’t need the commission; I need you to be safe.

	- 
	**Background:** I’m retired LAPD. I have my pension. I do this because I love it.

	

	- 
	**Integrity:** I will tell you "NO" on a bad house faster than I will tell you "YES" on a good one.

	

	- 
	**Innovation:** I use cutting-edge AI marketing (Honor Elevate) to find off-market deals and sell homes faster.

	

	- 
	**Discipline:** I bring the same discipline to this job that I brought to losing 135 lbs and serving the city. You get 110%, always.

	

#### **30. "What is the first step?"**

**The Action Plan:** We don't look at houses today.

	- 
	**Strategy Session:** We sit down (or Zoom).

	

	- 
	**Financing:** We get you fully Pre-Approved (not just pre-qualified) so your offer is as good as cash.

	

	- 
	**The Hunt:** Then, we go find your home.
