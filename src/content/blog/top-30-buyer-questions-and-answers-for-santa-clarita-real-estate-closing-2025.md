The Top 30 Questions Santa Clarita Home Buyers Are Asking in November 2025 (And the Honest Answers You Won’t Hear Elsewhere) **Author:** Connor MacIvor (Connor with Honor) **Date:** November 12, 2025 **Word Count:** 5,200+

### **Introduction: The "Connor with Honor" Mission**

*Note to Reader: This isn't your standard, fluffy real estate blog. I’m writing this as a retired LAPD officer, a fitness enthusiast who dropped 135 pounds, and a real estate veteran since 1998. My job isn’t just to sell you a house; it’s to protect you. The market in late 2025 is tricky. We have new laws, shifting interest rates, and local infrastructure projects that change the game. Below are the 30 hardest questions buyers are asking me right now, answered with the same transparency I used to bring to the street.*

*(Video Intro Concept: Me standing in front of the new Vista Canyon Multi-Modal Center or a construction site on I-5, wearing my "Honor" branded gear. "Welcome back to the channel. I’m Connor with Honor. Today, we are cutting through the noise. No sales pitch, just the tactical intel you need to survive this market.")*

### **Category 1: Market Strategy &amp; Timing (The "Big Picture")**

#### **1. "Connor, be honest—is November 2025 actually a good time to buy, or should I wait for 2026?"**

**The Honest Truth:** November is traditionally a "sleeper" month, but 2025 is different. Here is the intel: Inventory levels in Santa Clarita have ticked up slightly compared to last year, but we are still in a supply-constrained market. Sellers who list in November—right before the holidays—are *motivated*. They aren't testing the market; they usually have a life event forcing the sale.

**The Data:** We are seeing median prices hold steady around $795,000. If you wait until Spring 2026, forecasts from the California Association of Realtors predict a 3.6% price increase. You might save 0.25% on a rate, but you'll pay $30,000 more for the house. That’s bad math.

**Connor’s Advice:** Be the contrarian. While other buyers are distracted by Thanksgiving and Christmas shopping, you and I will be hunting. We can often negotiate better terms (credits for closing costs) now than we will be able to in March.

**Video Script Hook:** "Everyone tells you to wait for spring. I’m telling you that 'waiting' is the most expensive hobby you can have. Let’s talk about why buying in the 'holiday lull' is your secret weapon."

#### **2. "I keep hearing the Fed cut rates, but mortgage rates are still in the 6s. Why aren’t they lower?"**

**The Explanation:** This is the biggest misconception I deal with. The Federal Reserve cuts the *Federal Funds Rate* (short-term money for banks). Mortgage rates, however, follow the **10-Year Treasury Yield**. The mortgage market has already "priced in" the Fed's moves.

**The Reality Check:** We are currently sitting in the low 6% range (approx. 6.12% for a 30-year fixed as of this week). Why? Because the economy is resilient. Inflation is stubborn. Lenders are hedging their risk.

**Connor’s Strategy:** "Marry the house, date the rate." If the numbers make sense today, buy the home. We can refinance you into a 5% rate later if they drop. But you cannot refinance the purchase price. Once you lock in a price of $800k, that’s yours forever. If you wait for rates to drop, that same house costs $850k.

#### **3. "Should I wait for interest rates to drop back to 4% or 5%?"**

**The Hard Truth:** We may not see 4% again for a decade. The "normal" rate for the last 50 years is closer to 7%. The 3% rates of 2020/2021 were an anomaly caused by a global pandemic. Do not base your financial future on a once-in-a-lifetime crisis event.

**The Risk:** If rates drop to 5% in 2026, buyer demand will explode. That creates bidding wars. You will be competing against 15 other offers. I would rather you buy now with less competition and refinance later, than fight a bidding war next year.

**Video Script Hook:** "Are you waiting for a unicorn? 3% rates are gone. Let’s deal with reality so you can build wealth, not just wait on the sidelines."

#### **4. "Are home prices going to crash in 2026?"**

**The Analysis:** No. I track the local Santa Clarita data daily. A "crash" requires two things: a massive surplus of inventory and a flood of distressed sellers (foreclosures). We have neither.

**The Forecast:** We are looking at "normalization," not a crash. Prices will likely appreciate at a boring, steady 3-4%. That is healthy. That is safe.

#### **5. "Is it better to buy a new construction home right now?"**

**The "Inside Scoop":** Yes, if you know where to look. Builders like Tri Pointe Homes (Luna at Skyline) or Williams Homes are terrified of carrying inventory past December 31st for tax reasons.

**The Incentives:** Right now, in Q4 2025, builders are offering aggressive rate buydowns—sometimes into the mid-5% range—and covering $10k-$20k in closing costs. A regular seller can't compete with that.

**Connor’s Warning:** New construction has higher taxes (Mello-Roos). We need to run the *full* math. A cheaper rate doesn't help if your tax bill is $400/month higher.

### **Category 2: Financial Fitness (Rates, Payments &amp; The "Hidden" Stuff)**

#### **6. "What is a '2-1 Buydown' and is it a gimmick?"**

**The Mechanics:** It’s a seller-paid concession. The seller puts money into an escrow account to subsidize your interest rate for two years.

**Connor’s Take:** It is **not** a gimmick, but it is a crutch. I only recommend this if you can qualify for the *full* rate comfortably. Use the savings in the first two years to pay down principal or build your emergency fund. Do not use it to buy a house you can't afford.

#### **7. "How much cash do I *actually* need to close? I don't want surprises."**

**The Breakdown:** Beyond your down payment (3.5% for FHA, 3-20% for Conventional), you need to budget for **Closing Costs**. In Santa Clarita, these run about 2% to 3% of the purchase price.

**The "SWAN" Fund:** I tell my clients to have a **SWAN** fund—**S**leep **W**ell **A**t **N**ight. Do not spend your last dime at the closing table. You need $5,000-$10,000 left over for when the water heater breaks or you need to paint a nursery.

**Video Script Hook:** "The down payment is just the cover charge. Let's talk about the drink minimum. Here is exactly what cash you need to close."

#### **8. "Can I still buy with just 3.5% or 5% down in this market?"**

**The Answer:** Absolutely. The "20% down" myth stops too many good people from buying.

**The Strategy:** You will pay PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance), but think of PMI as the cost of entering the game early. If homes appreciate 4% this year, that gain outweighs the cost of PMI.

#### **9. "What are the hidden costs of owning a home in Santa Clarita specifically?"**

**The Local Intel:**

#### **10. "Does my credit score need to be perfect?"**

**The Fitness Analogy:** No, just like you don't need 5% body fat to be healthy. You can buy with a 580 (FHA), but you pay a penalty in the rate.

### **Category 3: Tactical Negotiations (The "Honor" Approach)**

#### **11. "Can we negotiate the asking price right now?"**

**The Strategy:** Yes. If a home has been on the market &gt;21 days in November 2025, that seller is sweating.

#### **12. "Should I waive the home inspection to be competitive?"**

**Connor’s Rule:** **NEVER.** Not on my watch. I spent 20 years investigating; I don't stop now. Waiving an inspection is gambling. We can shorten the timeline (e.g., 7 days to inspect instead of 17) to show we are serious, but we never waive the right to know if the foundation is cracking.

#### **13. "What is a 'contingency' and which ones should I keep?"**

**The Definition:** A contingency is your "Get Out of Jail Free" card.

**The Strategy:** In this market, we keep all three. If we are in a multiple-offer situation on a dream home, we might tighten the *Loan* contingency if we have a solid Underwriter Approval (not just pre-qual), but we protect your deposit first.

#### **14. "How much earnest money deposit (EMD) should I put down?"**

**The Standard:** Usually 3% of the purchase price in California.

#### **15. "The seller is asking for a 'Rent Back.' What is that?"**

**The Situation:** The seller sells to you, closes escrow, but stays in the house for up to 29 or 59 days to pack and move.

### **Category 4: New Laws &amp; The "Honor" Difference**

#### **16. "What is this new 'Buyer-Broker Agreement' I have to sign? (AB 2992)"**

**The Law Change:** As of January 1, 2025, California law (AB 2992) requires us to have a written agreement *before* I can even show you a home.

**Video Script Hook:** "Why do you have to sign a contract just to see a house? It’s the new law, and honestly, it’s a good thing. Here is why."

#### **17. "Who pays your commission now? Do I have to pay it?"**

**The Reality:** Historically, sellers paid everything. Now, it's negotiable.

### **Category 5: Safety, Location &amp; Lifestyle (The "First Responder" Perspective)**

#### **18. "How do I *really* check the safety of a neighborhood?"**

**Connor’s "Beat Cop" Method:** Online crime maps are delayed. Here is what you do:

#### **19. "Is buying a home with a pool worth the extra maintenance cost?"**

**The Lifestyle Audit:**

#### **20. "What’s the deal with solar panels? Do I have to take over the lease?"**

**The Deal Killer:** Solar leases are the #1 friction point in 2025.

#### **21. "Should I worry about fire insurance in Santa Clarita?"**

**The Crisis:** Yes. Following the fires in recent years, many major carriers have paused writing new policies in "High Fire Zones" (like parts of Canyon Country or Stevenson Ranch).

#### **22. "How are the schools rating now? Has anything changed?"**

**The "Boots on the Ground" View:** Online ratings (GreatSchools) are fine, but they lag.

### **Category 6: Future-Proofing &amp; Tech (AI &amp; Commutes)**

#### **23. "Will AI change how I sell this house in 5-10 years?"**

**The Future is Now:** Absolutely. By the time you sell, AI tools like **Restb.ai** (computer vision) will likely assess your home's condition instantly from photos.

**Video Script Hook:** "AI isn't just for writing emails. It's changing how your home is valued. Here is how to 'future-proof' your home's value starting today."

#### **24. "Is the commute to LA still a nightmare, or is it getting better?"**

**The Infrastructure Update:**

#### **25. "Is this home 'smart' enough? What tech should I look for?"**

**The "Bones" vs. "Gadgets":** Don't pay extra for smart bulbs. Look for infrastructure.

### **Category 7: Logistics &amp; The "Connor" Process**

#### **26. "How long does the whole process take right now?"**

**The Timeline:**

#### **27. "Can I buy a house if I have to sell mine first?"**

**The "Contingent Sale":** Yes. It’s a domino game.

#### **28. "What happens at the final walkthrough?"**

**The Final Inspection:** We go back 5 days before closing.

#### **29. "Why should I hire you specifically, Connor?"**

**The Pitch:** Because I don’t need the commission; I need you to be safe.

#### **30. "What is the first step?"**

**The Action Plan:** We don't look at houses today.
