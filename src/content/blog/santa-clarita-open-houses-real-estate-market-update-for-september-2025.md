# Santa Clarita Real Estate Bombshell: Active Listings Dip to 716 While Weekly Closings Spike to 46 – Buyer's Paradise or Seller's Wake-Up Call?

  
## TL;DR

Santa Clarita's housing market is showing signs of stabilization with active listings at 716, a slight dip that could signal tighter competition ahead. Weekly stats paint a dynamic picture: 75 new listings flooding in, 71 price changes as sellers adjust, 58 new pendings, and 46 closings in the last 7 days – up from recent trends. Expired listings hit 13, withdrawn 15, and back-on-market 22, highlighting deal breakers like inspections or financing. Dive deeper into price breakdowns, average square footage, year built trends, $/sqft metrics, and lot sizes across statuses – all tailored for what buyers crave (value hotspots, negotiation leverage) and sellers need (competition insights, pricing pitfalls). As a Realtor who's swapped LAPD pursuits for property deals (CALDRE 01238257), I'm breaking down why this data means buyers have leverage now, but sellers need sharp strategies to avoid stagnation. From entry-level condos to luxury estates, here's the no-fluff truth on Santa Clarita's market pulse as of September 24, 2025 – plus tips to win big.

As someone who's patrolled LA's chaotic streets as an ex-motor cop and now steers clients through Santa Clarita's equally unpredictable real estate twists, I know that numbers aren't just stats – they're roadmaps to smart decisions. From radar guns to market metrics, precision is key, and today's September 24, 2025, update is no exception. We're talking 716 active listings, a tweak from recent counts that could hint at inventory tightening. Why should you care? Because in a market where rates are teasing drops and buyers are selective, this dip might be your window to snag a deal – or a signal for sellers to price aggressively before the holidays slow things down.

But let's not stop at headlines. Buyers want to know: Where's the best value per square foot? How old are these homes, and what's the lot size sweet spot for family living? Sellers are asking: What's my competition in the $700K range, and why are so many listings expiring? Drawing from the latest CRMLS data in the "Daily santa clarita stats 09242025.pdf," we'll expand on every angle – doubling down on the insights to give you the full picture. Sarcasm alert: If you thought real estate was just "location, location, location," wait till you see how stats like average year built (1990s dominance) and $/sqft trends (dipping in luxury) flip the script. Whether you're hunting for a starter condo in Canyon Country or offloading a Valencia estate, this expanded breakdown has the goods. And if AI's your jam for smarter searches, peek at how tools from HonorElevate.com can automate your edge – but more on that later.

## Market Overview: 716 Actives Meet Weekly Whirlwind – The Full Snapshot Buyers and Sellers Crave

Let's start broad: Residential properties across Santa Clarita Valley (SCV) statuses total over 1,100, but the spotlight's on actives at 716. Average list price hovers at ~$898K, with median DOM at 66 – why matters for buyers? It means more time to inspect and negotiate, especially in oversupplied brackets. For sellers, it's a red flag: Lingering listings often lead to those 71 weekly price changes.

Overlay the 7-day bar chart for real-time vibes:

Why blend totals and weekly for buyers? Spot trends like rising closings signaling demand pickup – great for locking in before rates drop further. Sellers, those expired/withdrawn stats scream "overprice at your peril". Total inventory dip to 716? Could mean less choice soon, pushing prices up in high-demand areas like Valencia.

## Deep Dive into Active Listings: 716 Opportunities Sliced by Price – Value Metrics Buyers Obsess Over

With actives at 716, let's break by price using PDF stats – min/max/avg for list price, DOM, year built, sqft, $/sqft, lot sqft. Buyers, this reveals bargains (low $/sqft) and red flags (high DOM on older homes). Sellers, see your competition's specs to undercut smartly.

### Entry-Level Edge: $200K - $500K (94 Listings) – Affordable Starts with Hidden Gems

This bracket's buyer magnet for first-timers or downsizers, with plentiful options but longer DOM giving leverage.

Total here: Avg carport 1 space, suiting urban buyers. Why care? $/sqft rises with price, but lots balloon – value in land for future equity. For sellers, 89 avg DOM means market-test pricing early.

### Family Favorites: $500K - $1M (455 Listings) – Core Market with Space and Amenities Sellers Must Highlight

Over 60% of actives, where families flock for schools and space. Stats show '90s-'00s dominance, ideal for modern updates.

Why this range rules? Avg 2-4 beds, 2-3 baths, with $/sqft peaking mid-bracket then easing – buyers get more space as prices climb. Sellers, weekly 58 pendings pull from here; update '90s homes to close faster.

### Luxury Lures: $1M+ (167 Listings) – Premium Stats Sellers Use to Justify Asks, Buyers to Negotiate Down

Slower but rewarding, with bigger spreads in stats.

Buyers: Lower $/sqft in upper tiers (e.g., $394 at $1.4M) means luxury value; newer builds ('18+) close quicker. Sellers: High DOM (89 avg in $1.2M) due to scrutiny – offer inspections upfront.

## Pending Power: 199 Deals in the Works – Speed and SP/LP Ratios Sellers Benchmark Against

Pending totals ~199, avg $878K, DOM 55 – quicker than actives. Breakdown:

Weekly 58 new pendings show momentum in mid-range. Sellers: Match these specs (e.g., 3-4 beds) to pend faster. Buyers: Watch for back-on-market from here – instant opportunities.

## Closings Climb: 46 Weekly Wins – $/Sqft and Lot Insights for Post-Sale Comps

46 closings last week, avg $806K at 99.2% list, DOM 43. Key stats:

Why buyers study closings? Comps set appraisals; low $/sqft signals under-market buys. Sellers: Use for pricing – over-ask risks expiration.

## Adjustments Abound: 71 Price Changes &amp; 22 Back-On-Market – Competition Stats Sellers Can't Ignore

71 changes weekly, often in $700K+ where 120+ actives compete. Back-on 22: Avg 3-bed '95, 2,000 sqft. Expired 13: High DOM on '80s homes with small $/sqft appeal. Withdrawn 15: Luxury with big lots but outdated features.

Sellers: Analyze comps by year built – newer closes faster. Buyers: Pounce on adjustments for deals.

## Coming Soon Teasers: 5 New, Total 6 – Preview Stats for Early Buyers

All 4-bed, avg '90 build, 2,162 sqft at $441/sqft, lots from 5.5K-159K. Buyers: Median $889K – scout for value.

## Neighborhood Nuances: Canyon Country to Valencia – Localized Stats for Targeted Hunts

Canyon Country: Heavy under $500K, avg '85 build, smaller lots – affordable with quick DOM. Valencia: Mid-luxury, '00s builds, larger sqft – inventory building. Acton: Rural lots in $1M+, older builds. Why localize? Tailor to lifestyle.

## Fed &amp; Rates: Powell's Teases Amid Market Dip – Impact on SCV Affordability

Two more meetings could cut rates, boosting affordability. Why for buyers? Lower rates stretch budgets in $600K bracket (avg $431/sqft). Sellers: Expect surge post-cut. Prep FICO.
