We’ll take a seat, sip a coffee, and get into the nitty-gritty of Santa Clarita real estate in 2025. So let’s jump in.

### 1. Transcription from My Latest Real Estate Video

*(Below is the transcript of the daily update I provided, discussing rising inventory, strategic pricing, and the interplay between Mello-Roos taxes and HOA fees.)*

*Let’s talk about our Santa Clarita real estate update. We are creeping up in numbers of inventory that have been coming onto the market over the last two to three weeks. We did have the last year slowdown, as we see—that’s very indicative of every year during holidays. But now, as we get into 2025, we’re watching as the market is starting to move a little bit faster.*

*However, the same issues are coming out with properties that are getting placed on the market. In some cases, those listing prices are based on 90 or 180-day-in-the-future estimates of value, and they’re being based on a particular percentage. I don’t know if it’s the agents telling the people this or if they’re seeing this online.*

*Now, of course, it would seem that all things indicate real estate’s gonna continue to become more and more expensive throughout 2025 and maybe the next couple of years after—barring any kind of massive economic worldwide or even localized economic disturbance. But even with that, whenever you price a property, you want to be very close to fair market value or maybe a little above, but not so overzealous where people are trying to figure out how you could have priced it that way, not seeing any kind of variables that would indicate that that would be an acceptable price.*

*Buyers still have choices. If yours was the only house for sale, then no issue, but the problem is you’re in competition with other sellers, and other sellers might have the right idea in mind where they are pricing their properties very strategically out of the gate.*

*The other thing: if you’re selling a house that has a high Mello-Roos tax or a very expensive HOA—and very expensive is just basically above the norm, if you’re getting above $200—things change a little bit, depending on the buyer drive in your area. If you’re less than that, then usually you know green means go in a certain way.*

*If you’re looking at Mello-Roos taxes and your property has higher than normal Mello-Roos taxes—and there are some developments out here that carry extremely high, almost paying double taxes—that’s going to impact your sales price. So if you’re expecting to get as much for your residence as a similarly built residence—similar square footage that’s in a different zip code or different city or different neighborhood that doesn’t have Mello-Roos tax—then that’s probably not going to happen. So your price is going to have to be set accordingly.*

*You can see this in new housing. You go to my main website, [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com). The new housing there, you can find and see that some of these HOAs have exceeded $1,000 a month. Those properties are in the sixes and the sevens versus where they could be without that, in the millions of dollars.*

*I’m Connor with Honor. We’ll see you in the next real estate update. Be well. You can check out my new book at [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/book). We’ll see you in the next one—over and out.*

### 2. Rising Santa Clarita Inventory: A Deeper Look

Santa Clarita, in recent weeks, is seeing a noticeable uptick in housing inventory. This phenomenon typically happens after the holiday slowdown—buyers and sellers often prefer focusing on gatherings and celebrations in November and December. By January, everyone is making fresh starts, and that includes listing property.

Now, creeping into 2025, we see the data:

	- **Coming Soon**: 12 listings at the time of the Matrix stats.

	- **Active**: 485 properties in total, ranging from the low $200,000s to multi-million-dollar estates.

	- **Active Under Contract**: 90

	- **Pending**: 151

	- **Closed** (January 15 to January 22, 2025): 20

	- **Expired**: 5

	- **Canceled**: 10

	- **Hold**: 33

	- **Withdrawn**: 42

That’s a lot of market movement for a single region. You can see updated “Active Listings” anytime at [Santa Clarita Active Listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings). This inventory data is a prime indicator that local sellers are trying to test the waters, and some are over-pricing. Meanwhile, buyers are out there, but they’re not all biting if the price is unrealistic.

#### Why This Matters

	- **Increased Competition**: More active listings mean buyers have greater choice. If you’re a seller, you can’t just throw a random number out there and expect a bidding war.

	- **Expired and Canceled**: The presence of 15 or so combined Expired and Canceled listings in a short timeframe suggests some sellers got tired of waiting. Possibly, they overshot their initial price.

	- **Coming Soon**: With 12 “Coming Soon” listings, it indicates the pipeline is full. If you’re waiting to list, you’ll face more competition.

### 3. Strategic Pricing: The Common Pitfall of Over-Pricing

From my personal vantage point—and as outlined in the above transcription—**over-pricing** remains the biggest Achilles heel for Santa Clarita sellers. You see it time and again:

	- Sellers look at a “future” market value, tacking on 3–5% to “anticipate” appreciation over the next quarter or half-year.

	- Sellers whose neighbors sold 2–3 months ago might assume upward continuity, ignoring that interest rates fluctuate, or that today’s buyer sentiment is different.

	- Some sellers rely on the inaccurate “Zestimate” or general advice they found on a national website not updated with local real-time data.

**Your solution** is to anchor your property to a fair price from the get-go. That means checking real comps that closed within the last 30 days, referencing active competition in your immediate neighborhood, factoring in the Mello-Roos or HOA costs, and setting an asking price that’s compelling but not undervalued. The last thing you want is a “dinosaur listing” that sits for months, eventually leading you to slash the price anyway.

*Pro-tip: If your property is in a community with high Mello-Roos or a monthly HOA that’s nearing $500, you have to factor that into your final number. For more details on how to structure your sale in high-fee communities, see my article on [High HOA and Mello-Roos Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/blog) (look for posts specifically about these topics).*

### 4. Mello-Roos Taxes, HOA Fees, and How They Affect Your Bottom Line

Mello-Roos taxes and large HOAs have become the new norm in certain Santa Clarita communities. Developers finance infrastructure through Mello-Roos bonds, passing the cost onto homeowners via an annual or semi-annual payment. Meanwhile, HOAs can become quite large if the development includes multiple amenities like pools, fitness centers, gated security, and landscaping.

**Key Observations**:

	- **HOAs Above $200** – Once you cross into that territory, it starts to raise eyebrows for many buyers—especially first-time homebuyers on a tight monthly budget. You add $200–$500 in monthly HOA fees on top of your mortgage, and the property might become less affordable.

	- **Mello-Roos** – Some developments have Mello-Roos that effectively double a homeowner’s tax burden. That’s a big chunk to swallow.

	- **Trade-Off** – Newer homes with more amenities vs. older homes with no Mello-Roos but perhaps an older style. Many buyers who prefer bigger space, 21st-century design, and a brand-new environment might put up with Mello-Roos. Others want to avoid extra taxes like the plague.

If you’re a seller, you must price accordingly. A nearly identical floor plan in a non-Mello-Roos area will fetch a higher net, simply because the buyer’s monthly overhead is lower. Overpricing your Mello-Roos property is a surefire way to scare off offers.

Check out my [Real Estate Glossary](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/real-estate-glossary) for a thorough explanation of Mello-Roos and how it compares to standard property taxes.

### 5. Are You Competing with a “Dream Home Finder” Mindset?

Buyers, let me give you a fatherly, no-nonsense approach: You do have choices in 2025. Don’t settle for a home that’s overpriced when you can likely find a comparable property with equal or better features priced more in line with current fair market value.

**Your Starting Points**:

	- **[Dream Home Finder](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/dream-home-finder)** – This search tool is your friend. Input your preferences, square footage, location, bed/bath count, and let the system do the heavy lifting.

	- **[Advanced Search](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/advanced-search)** – If you want to dial in your search or prefer more specialized parameters, you’ll want to explore advanced filters that let you hone in on features like gated communities, horse property, or near-a-vineyard properties.

	- **[Mortgage Rates](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/mortgage-rates)** – Keep track daily, because those rates shift. And as interest rates decline or spike, your purchasing power changes significantly.

Here’s a personal example I give my clients: Suppose your rate is 6.5% vs. 7.0%. You may not think that’s a huge difference, but it can significantly affect your monthly payment, thereby altering your total approved purchase price range.

### 6. Breaking Down Market Stats from Matrix

You might have seen me share a snippet of CRMLS/Matrix stats in my updates. Let’s parse them a bit to show how we interpret all this data in an ongoing manner:

	- 
	**Active Listings** range across nearly every price band:

	
		Some in the $200,000–$300,000 bracket (often older condos, smaller units).

		- A large cluster in the $600,000–$700,000 and $700,000–$800,000 range.

		- A modest group in the $900,000–$1,000,000 bracket.

		- Several million-dollar listings above $1.2M, especially in Valencia, Stevenson Ranch, and Saugus where new construction or custom homes are more prevalent.

	

	
	- 
	**Active Under Contract &amp; Pending**: This portion of the data, around 241 total between them, suggests solid buyer activity. Even with holiday slowdowns in the rearview mirror, people are transacting.

	

	- 
	**Canceled, Expired, Withdrawn**: Why do these matter? They show unsuccessful attempts to sell. Typically, it’s a sign that either the property was overpriced, or the seller pulled out for personal reasons. If you see a property canceled at $1.4M, it might reappear in a few weeks as a “Coming Soon” at a different price.

	

**Conclusion**: The market is humming along, but you must remain aware that the “list-high/wait-for-an-offer” approach is increasingly risky.

[Canyon Country](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/canyon-country-homes) is a fantastic blend of older neighborhoods and newer builds, with a wide range of listing prices.

### 8. Overcoming Pricing Challenges: Three Scenarios for Sellers

Let’s break down three realistic scenarios I often see with sellers:

#### Scenario A: The Optimistic Over-Pricer

	- **Situation**: A seller sees a neighbor’s home sold for $775,000 last June. They figure it’s now 2025, so let’s list it for $850,000. “The market is always going up, right?”

	- **Outcome**: Minimal showings, no strong offers, property sits on the market. Eventually, they reduce to $799,000 but by that time the listing has gone stale. Buyers wonder, “What’s wrong with it?”

**Advice**: Don’t risk staleness. Price it near or slightly above the last best comp.

#### Scenario B: The Mello-Roos Blind Spot

	- **Situation**: A brand-new property in Saugus or Valencia with $5,000 per year in Mello-Roos. The seller thinks they’ll recoup the same price as a non-Mello-Roos property.

	- **Outcome**: Buyers do the math and realize the monthly overhead is too high. Offers come in $20,000–$30,000 lower than what the seller expects.

**Advice**: If your Mello-Roos is high, account for it in your pricing. Alternatively, pay off some or all of the bond if feasible to sweeten the deal.

#### Scenario C: High HOA + Upgrades

	- **Situation**: A condo with a $500/month HOA, albeit a complex with a gym, pool, and rooftop lounge. The seller spent $50,000 on interior upgrades and wants top dollar.

	- **Outcome**: Some buyers will love the amenities, but many recoil at the monthly HOA. That can translate to lower offers or fewer showings.

**Advice**: Market the lifestyle, not just the property. Show how the $500 fee covers more than just a pool—maybe it covers water, trash, internet, and security. Make sure to highlight these benefits in your listing remarks.

### 9. The Buyer’s Perspective: Do You Have Leverage?

Buyers in 2025, I’m speaking directly to you now. The big question is, “Do I have any leverage in this market?” The short answer: **Yes, you do.** More inventory is hitting the market, as evidenced by active listings creeping upwards. While prices are not necessarily crashing, you can find bargains if:

	- **You’re flexible on neighborhood** – Maybe your heart was set on a specific Valencia tract, but there’s a comparable home in Saugus for $30,000 less. Being open-minded can pay off.

	- **You’re well-qualified** – With an actual pre-approval letter from your lender (not a “pre-qualification”), listing agents see you as a serious buyer. That’s leverage.

	- **You’re patient but ready** – Don’t panic-buy. On the other hand, if an excellent property is fairly priced, jump on it. Otherwise, you risk losing out to a more decisive buyer.

Check daily for updated stats or new listings in your price band. You can do that using [Quick Search](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/quick-search) or the [Advanced Search](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/advanced-search) on my site.

### 10. Open Houses: Are They Worth Attending?

You bet. Open houses give you a no-pressure environment to see multiple homes in a single day. If you’re new to the area or exploring a city like [Stevenson Ranch](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-stevenson-ranch-ca) or [Canyon Country](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/canyon-country-homes), a handful of open houses can help you get a sense of the neighborhoods.

For an up-to-date list of open houses in Santa Clarita, see [Homes with an Open House for Sale in Santa Clarita CA](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-with-an-open-house-for-sale-in-santa-clarita-ca) or simply browse our dedicated [Santa Clarita Open Houses Today](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-open-houses-today) page.

*Note*: If you’re not ready to commit to an agent quite yet, remember that if you love a property and want to write an offer, you’ll need a dedicated buyer’s agent who knows how to protect you. I can’t stress the value of strong representation enough—someone to negotiate, check Mello-Roos disclosures, and ensure your inspection period is well-managed.

### 11. For Sale By Owner (FSBO) or Hiring a Realtor?

Some folks consider doing it alone. However, as both a father figure and an ex-LAPD officer, I can assure you: real estate transactions are legally complex, and going FSBO might cost you more in mistakes than any potential commission savings.

If you’re curious about pros and cons, read my dedicated post: [For Sale By Owner—A Good Idea?](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/for-sale-by-owner-a-good-idea) which breaks down all the hidden pitfalls, including limited exposure on the MLS, potential legal missteps, and the negotiation advantage you lose without a pro in your corner.

### 12. Resources for Informed Decisions

I always remind my clients: a well-informed decision is the best one you can make. Take advantage of the following:

	- **[Mortgage Rates](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/mortgage-rates)** – Keep a close eye on these.

	- **[Real Estate Glossary](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/real-estate-glossary)** – Quick definitions for complex terms like “Mello-Roos,” “Earnest Money Deposit,” “Contingency,” etc.

	- **[Testimonials](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/testimonials)** – Hear from clients I’ve helped. It’s one thing for me to say I’m your best bet; it’s another to see real feedback from real sellers and buyers.

	- **[About](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/about)** – If you’re curious about my background, story, or how a First Responder turned Realtor can serve you best, read away.

	- **[Contact](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/contact)** – Drop me a line for direct questions or to schedule a chat.

	- **[SCV OH - Santa Clarita Open Houses Held Saturday](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-open-houses-held-saturday)** – If weekend open houses are your jam, keep track of these.

And if you want the next best thing to a personal mentor for your home-buying or selling journey, consider my new book available at [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/book](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/book). Packed with real-world scenarios, checklists, and secrets gleaned from years in real estate and service as a policeman.

### 13. My Personal Take: The 2025 Santa Clarita Outlook

2025 looks to be a year of cautious optimism. Barring unforeseen global or national economic surprises, Santa Clarita remains an attractive region for families, professionals, and retirees. It’s close enough to Los Angeles but still feels suburban, with good schools and lower crime rates than many other LA County areas.

	- **Price Growth**: Yes, it’s likely. Nothing extreme, though. Expect moderate appreciation.

	- **Inventory**: Likely to stay higher than it was during the frenzied periods in 2021–2022.

	- **Interest Rates**: Subject to Fed policy—if they drop a half point, watch buyer activity surge. If they rise, watch buying power shrink.

I predict that the new construction developments with heavy HOAs/Mello-Roos will continue drawing in certain buyer segments who want brand-new everything. Meanwhile, established neighborhoods with no Mello-Roos remain hot commodities, especially if the owners do a fresh remodel.

### 14. Tips for Sellers Entering the Market Now

	- **Prepare Your Home**: Simple staging or repainting can dramatically increase appeal.

	- **Check the Comps**: If the last 3 sales near you closed at $820k, $830k, and $835k, you’re not going to list at $900k with zero justification.

	- **Disclose Mello-Roos/HOAs Clearly**: The more transparent you are, the more trust you build with potential buyers. Surprises kill deals.

	- **Use Quality Photography &amp; Video**: We’re in a digital age, and that first impression (online) counts.

For more, see my [Seller’s Guide](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/sellers-guide), which has a deeper breakdown of a robust marketing plan.

### 15. Tips for Buyers Facing Multiple Listings

	- **Get Properly Pre-Approved**: Don’t rely on automated pre-qualification. Work with a reputable lender.

	- **Identify Your Must-Haves vs. Nice-to-Haves**: If you absolutely need 4 bedrooms for the kids, don’t waste time on 3-bedroom listings hoping to “make it work.”

	- **Go See Properties Early**: If you see a listing on Wednesday for a place that checks all your boxes, don’t wait until Sunday’s open house. Request a showing ASAP.

	- **Have Patience**: The right home will come along. Resist the fear of missing out (FOMO).

You’ll find more details in my [Buyer’s Guide](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/buyers-guide).

### 16. Final Thoughts: The Importance of Having an Expert Advisor

Santa Clarita is not just one “blob” of suburban sprawl. It’s a tapestry of unique micro-markets, each with its own pricing intricacies, fee structures, and pitfalls. The difference between a smooth transaction and a regret-filled fiasco can come down to who’s advising you. Having patrolled these streets as a first responder, I’ve gained a sense of vigilance and attention to detail that I bring to every real estate deal. My job is to keep you safe—legally, financially, and strategically.

### 18. Building a Million-Dollar Business Through SEO and Value

A little behind-the-scenes insight for you: My dedication to local SEO and transparent content creation isn’t just for show. It’s part of how I’ve built a lasting real estate practice in Santa Clarita—my “million-dollar business.” By focusing on:

	- **Accurate, Up-to-Date Data** – No clickbait or outdated stats.

	- **Transparency** – Full disclosures on fees, taxes, and potential pitfalls.

	- **Community Involvement** – Understanding the local nuances, from city regulations to hidden neighborhoods.

I want you to see me as both a trusted advisor and an approachable neighbor. One of my personal life philosophies is that a fatherly or motherly approach (patience, kindness, wit) resonates deeply with clients, especially those new to real estate. People want to be led, but never coerced or rushed. That’s precisely how I do business.

### 19. Checking Out My Book: Fat to Fit, Real Estate, and More

You heard me mention “my new book.” You might be wondering, “What’s that about?” Well, if you’re curious about:

	- How I dropped from a 65” waist to a 34” waist (fat to fit journey),

	- How I incorporate the discipline from law enforcement into real estate negotiations,

	- And how you, too, can channel personal transformations into successful property endeavors…

…then please take a moment to browse [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/book](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/book). It’s part inspirational memoir, part real estate insider’s guide, and part accountability partner.

### 21. Final Word: My Fatherly Approach and Sarcastic Wit

As your “kind and loving father” figure in real estate—who’s traveled the world, faced high-stakes scenarios as a police officer, and learned how crucial patience and strategy can be—I promise to guide you with warmth, honesty, and a dash of fatherly humor. Look, real estate can be stressful. But with the right knowledge, you’ll see it’s also an adventure. If you sense sarcasm, it’s just me lightening the mood—like teaching your teenager how to drive stick shift while cracking jokes so nobody panics.

The “NOW mindset” I often mention is about staying present, not overthinking, but also not ignoring red flags. Let’s keep it real, focus on the facts, confirm the data, and remember that at the end of the day, we all want a better life for ourselves and our families.

I hope this 4,000-word blog post has given you a thorough perspective on Santa Clarita’s rising inventory, strategic pricing, Mello-Roos intricacies, and the entire scope of real estate resources available on [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com).

If you remember nothing else, remember this:

	- **Price Right** – Over-pricing is the fastest route to buyer apathy.

	- **Watch Fees** – Mello-Roos and high HOAs can sink your listing if you disregard how they affect buyer affordability.

	- **Seek Knowledge** – Use the extensive library of pages, guides, and advanced search tools to outmaneuver the competition.

	- **Hire an Expert** – Whether that’s me or someone else with local credibility, don’t walk this path alone.
