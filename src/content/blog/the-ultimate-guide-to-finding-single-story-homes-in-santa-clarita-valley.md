# The Ultimate Guide to Finding Single-Story Homes in Santa Clarita Valley

## TL;DR

Single-story homes in Santa Clarita Valley are rare, making up just 25.4% of single-family residences in a market of 493 active listings. Buyers face challenges like HOA restrictions, limited RV parking, and fierce competition for these properties. This guide breaks down how to find your ideal single-story home, avoid common pitfalls, and leverage Connor MacIvor’s expertise as a First Responder Realtor to secure your dream home. Visit [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/) to start your search and contact Connor for personalized guidance.

## Why Single-Story Homes Are a Hot Commodity in Santa Clarita

If you’re hunting for a single-story home in Santa Clarita Valley, you’re not alone. These properties are in high demand for their accessibility, open layouts, and appeal to everyone from retirees to young families. But here’s the catch: they’re hard to come by. In a recent snapshot of the market, out of 493 active single-family residences, only 125 were single-story. That’s a mere 25.4%, meaning about one in four homes fits the bill. The rest? A whopping 74.6% are two-story homes, dominating the inventory.

Why does this matter? Single-story homes often command a premium because of their scarcity and versatility. Whether you’re in Valencia, Saugus, or Canyon Country, the competition for these properties is fierce. Prices per square foot tend to be higher for single-story homes compared to their two-story counterparts, especially when they’re well-maintained or boast unique features like RV parking or no HOA. For example, a gem like the property at 22206 Claibourne Lane in Circle J Ranch, Saugus, priced at $949,000, checks boxes for single-story, no HOA, and RV parking—features that disappear fast in this market.

As Connor MacIvor, your First Responder Realtor, I’ve seen buyers scramble to snag these homes. My background as a former LAPD officer taught me to cut through the noise and focus on what matters: real data, real strategies, and real results. In this guide, I’ll walk you through everything you need to know to find a single-story home in Santa Clarita Valley, avoid costly mistakes, and make a smart move in a competitive market. Ready? Let’s get started.

## Understanding the Santa Clarita Real Estate Market

Santa Clarita Valley’s real estate market is dynamic, with neighborhoods like Valencia, Saugus, Newhall, and Canyon Country offering diverse options. As of June 2025, the market is buzzing with activity, boasting over 786 active listings across single-family homes, condos, and townhomes. This high inventory creates a balanced market, giving buyers more choices but also intensifying competition for rare finds like single-story homes.

To put it in perspective, the 493 single-family residences mentioned earlier break down to 368 two-story and 125 single-story homes. This data, pulled straight from the MLS, highlights the challenge: single-story homes are a quarter of the market, and they don’t stick around long. Whether you’re eyeing a gated community in Stevenson Ranch or a spacious lot in Acton, understanding these numbers is key to setting realistic expectations.

For the latest market insights, check out the [Santa Clarita Market Report](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-market-report). It’s your go-to resource for staying ahead of trends and making informed decisions. And if you’re wondering how to navigate this market, my team at [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/) has the tools and expertise to guide you every step of the way.

## Why Single-Story Homes Are So Desirable

Single-story homes aren’t just a trend—they’re a lifestyle choice. Here’s why buyers in Santa Clarita are clamoring for them:

	- **Accessibility**: Perfect for retirees, those with mobility needs, or anyone who wants to avoid stairs.

	- **Open Layouts**: Many single-story homes feature spacious, flowing floor plans ideal for entertaining or family life.

	- **Low Maintenance**: No upper levels mean less upkeep, especially for exterior maintenance like painting or roof repairs.

	- **Resale Value**: Their scarcity and broad appeal make them a solid investment.

But desirability comes with challenges. Single-story homes often sell faster and at a higher price per square foot. For instance, a well-kept single-story in Valencia might fetch a premium over a comparable two-story home in the same neighborhood. Add in features like a cul-de-sac location or no Mello-Roos, and you’re looking at a property that’s gone before you can blink.

## Key Considerations When Buying a Single-Story Home

Finding the right single-story home isn’t just about checking the “one level” box. You need to think about features, restrictions, and long-term goals. Here are the top factors to consider, based on my years of helping buyers in Santa Clarita.

### HOA Restrictions: Know the Rules

Homeowners’ Associations (HOAs) are common in Santa Clarita, especially in planned communities like Valencia or Stevenson Ranch. While HOAs maintain neighborhood standards, they can limit your ability to customize your home. Want to add RV parking, expand the kitchen, or install a backyard gazebo? You’ll need HOA approval, and that’s not always a slam dunk.

For example, if you’re eyeing a single-story home in a Valencia HOA community, you might face restrictions on exterior changes, like adding a covered patio or even parking a boat in your driveway. I’ve seen buyers get frustrated when they realize they can’t make their dream home their own. My advice? Review the HOA’s CC&amp;Rs (Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions) before making an offer. If you want freedom to modify your property, consider homes with no HOA, like those in [Saugus](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-saugus-ca) or [Acton](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-acton-ca).

### RV Parking: A Rare Find

If you own an RV, boat, or trailer, finding a single-story home with RV parking is like hitting the jackpot. In Santa Clarita, only a handful of properties—about a dozen at any given time—offer gated RV parking. These homes, often in neighborhoods like Circle J Ranch or Castaic, are snapped up quickly, especially in a hot market.

Take the Claibourne Lane property in Saugus. It’s a single-story home with a fenced-in pool, no HOA, and gated RV parking—a rare combination. If RV access is a must, use the [Advanced Search](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/advanced-search) tool on my site to filter for homes with this feature. And don’t wait—these properties don’t last.

### Lot Size and Expansion Potential

Single-story homes often have smaller footprints than two-story homes, so lot size matters. If you’re dreaming of a big backyard for a pool, cornhole court, or future addition, you’ll need a property with room to grow. Some single-story homes, especially older ones in Newhall or Canyon Country, sit on larger lots that allow for expansions, provided zoning and HOA rules permit.

I’ve worked with clients who turned a single-story home into their forever home by adding a master suite or outdoor living space. But here’s the kicker: you can’t change the lot’s dimensions. If you buy a home with a tiny yard, you’re stuck with it. Before you fall in love with a property, ask yourself: Does it have space for my family’s needs? Can I add on later? My [Dream Home Finder](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/dream-home-finder) tool lets you specify lot size and other must-haves to narrow your search.

### Cul-de-Sac and Privacy

A single-story home at the end of a cul-de-sac with no back neighbors? That’s the holy grail for many buyers. These properties offer privacy, safety, and a quiet vibe—perfect for families or anyone who values seclusion. The Circle J Ranch home at 22206 Claibourne Lane is a prime example: single-story, cul-de-sac location, no HOA, and a view with no rear neighbors.

But these homes are rare, especially when you add other wish-list items like RV parking or no Mello-Roos. In my experience, buyers who prioritize cul-de-sac properties need to act fast and work with an agent who knows the market inside out. That’s where I come in—reach out via [Contact](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/contact) to stay ahead of new listings.

## How to Find Single-Story Homes in Santa Clarita

Searching for a single-story home in Santa Clarita requires strategy and the right tools. Here’s how to do it right:

### Use Local Search Tools

Forget national platforms like Zillow or Redfin—they’re cluttered with ads and outdated listings. At [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/), my search tools are built for Santa Clarita buyers. You can browse all active listings without registering, and there’s no spam or pop-ups. Use the [Quick Search](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/quick-search) for a fast overview or the [Advanced Search](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/advanced-search) to filter for single-story homes (look for “levels” or “single-story” options).

### Filter for Your Must-Haves

Most MLS systems let you filter for single-story homes, but the terminology varies. On my site, you can select “single-story” or “one level” to see exactly what’s available. Want a home with a pool? Check out [Homes with a Pool](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-with-a-pool-for-sale-in-santa-clarita-ca). Need a specific neighborhood? Try [Search by Area](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/search-by-area) to focus on Valencia, Saugus, or beyond.

### Check Open Houses

Open houses are a great way to see single-story homes in person. With over 150 open houses scheduled weekly in Santa Clarita, you’ve got options. Visit [Homes with an Open House](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-with-an-open-house-for-sale-in-santa-clarita-ca) to find upcoming events. Pro tip: Bring a trusted agent (like me) to ask the right questions and spot red flags.

### Work with a Local Expert

National websites can’t match the insight of a local realtor who lives and breathes Santa Clarita real estate. I pull data directly from the MLS, not syndicated feeds, so you get accurate, up-to-date information. Plus, my First Responder background means I’m all about cutting through the BS and getting you results. Ready to start? Use the [Dream Home Finder](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/dream-home-finder) or reach out via [Contact](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/contact).

## Navigating the Competitive Market

Santa Clarita’s market is hot, especially for single-story homes. With inventory at historic highs (786 listings in June 2025), you’d think it’s a buyer’s market—but rare properties still spark bidding wars. Here’s how to stand out:

	- **Get Pre-Approved**: A pre-approval letter shows sellers you’re serious. Visit [Getting Pre-Approved](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/getting-a-legitimate-lender-and-getting-pre-approved) for tips on finding a legit lender.

	- **Act Fast**: Single-story homes, especially those with RV parking or no HOA, can go under contract in days. Set up alerts on [Active Listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings) to stay ahead.

	- **Make a Strong Offer**: Work with an agent who knows how to analyze comparable sales and craft competitive offers. I use real MLS data, not guesses, to ensure your offer shines.

	- **Avoid Lowballing**: In a hot market, lowball offers on single-story homes rarely work. Trust your agent to guide you on pricing—check out [Considering Offers](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/considering-offers) for more.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

I’ve seen buyers make costly errors when chasing single-story homes. Here’s what to watch out for:

	- **Ignoring HOA Rules**: Falling in love with a home only to discover you can’t add RV parking or a patio is heartbreaking. Always review CC&amp;Rs early.

	- **Skipping Due Diligence**: Don’t trust verbal claims about market trends or property features. Ask for proof in writing, like MLS data or inspection reports. See [Importance of Inspection](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/importance-of-inspection).

	- **Not Checking Lot Size**: A small lot might limit your plans for a pool or addition. Use [Advanced Search](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/advanced-search) to filter for lot size.

	- **Going It Alone**: Without an agent, you’re at a disadvantage in a competitive market. A local expert like me can spot deals and negotiate on your behalf—see [Why Working with a First Responder Realtor](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-working-with-a-first-responder-turned-realtor-gives-you-the-edge).
