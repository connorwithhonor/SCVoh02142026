# Market Insights by Status and Type: A Comprehensive Analysis

*By your trusted Santa Clarita real estate advisor*

Real estate is not “one size fits all.” Whether you’re a first‑time buyer, a seasoned seller, or an investor looking for your next opportunity, understanding how properties perform across different statuses and types is essential to making smart decisions. In this post, we’ll dive into our latest “Statistics by Status and Type” report—which covers everything from properties that are “Coming Soon” to those that have “Closed” or even been “Withdrawn.” We’ll explore the data for each property type (Condominiums, Single Family Residences, and Townhouses) and explain what these numbers mean for you.

Our discussion will be organized by status. For each status, we’ll review key metrics such as list price, days on market, sale price-to-list price ratios, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, year built, square footage, price per square foot, lot size, and additional features (like carport spaces). Let’s begin by taking a closer look at what these statuses mean in our dynamic Santa Clarita market.

## Table of Contents

## 1. Introduction

In today’s fast‑paced real estate market, understanding every stage of a listing’s life cycle is key. Our latest data set—“Statistics by Status and Type”—allows us to break down properties by their current status (from “Coming Soon” to “Closed” and everything in between) as well as by property type (Condominium, Single Family Residence, Townhouse). This granular analysis helps you see not only how properties are priced and how quickly they sell but also reveals important trends that can inform your next move.

Whether you’re interested in the upcoming “Coming Soon” listings that haven’t hit the market yet, the properties actively competing in today’s market, or the final sale numbers from closed transactions, this post is designed to provide you with actionable insights. Let’s start with the “Coming Soon” category.

## 2. Coming Soon Properties: A Preview by Type

“Coming Soon” listings are those properties that have not yet officially hit the market. They’re generating buzz and anticipation among buyers and often give us early clues about future market conditions. In our data set, we have 10 “Coming Soon” properties broken down by type.

### 2.1. Condominium – Coming Soon

For “Coming Soon” condominiums (n = 2):

**What Does This Tell Us?**

Coming Soon condominiums in Santa Clarita are positioned in the mid‑$600K range. Although a small sample, the data indicates a moderate increase in size, newer construction on the higher end, and variability in lot size—all factors that may appeal to buyers looking for a low‑maintenance lifestyle combined with outdoor space. For those eager to see what’s about to hit the market, consider setting up alerts on our [Dream Home Finder](/contact) tool.

### 2.2. Single Family Residence – Coming Soon

For “Coming Soon” Single Family Residences (n = 8):

**Analysis:**

The Single Family Residence category in Coming Soon shows a wide price range—from more modest homes to upscale properties nearing $1.5 million. The average price above $1.1 million and median around $1.17 million indicate that the market is gearing up for higher‑end inventory soon. The diversity in sizes, ages, and lot sizes reflects the heterogeneous nature of the Santa Clarita market. Sellers may be positioning these homes strategically ahead of time, while buyers should prepare for a competitive environment once these listings become active.

### 2.3. Overall “Coming Soon” Market

When combining both types (n = 10):

**Key Takeaway:**

The Coming Soon market is hinting at an inventory mix that spans from affordable single‑family homes to high‑end residences, with condominiums clustering in the mid‑range. For buyers and investors, keeping an eye on these Coming Soon listings can provide a head start on negotiating favorable offers.

## 3. Active Listings: The Heartbeat of the Market

Active listings are the properties currently available for sale. They represent the market’s current pulse, reflecting the supply that buyers can immediately choose from. In our data, there are 509 active listings divided into three property types.

### 3.1. Active – Condominium

For Active Condominiums (n = 102):

**Market Implications:**

Active condominiums are generally more affordable than single‑family homes, making them attractive to first‑time buyers, downsizers, or investors looking for rental opportunities. The days on market suggest that while these properties are competitive, they might require a slightly longer search period compared to more aggressively priced single‑family homes.

### 3.2. Active – Single Family Residence

For Active Single Family Residences (n = 353):

**Insights:**

The Single Family Residence category clearly dominates in volume and value. With such a broad range of prices and sizes, this segment caters to a wide array of buyer needs—from those entering the market to luxury buyers. The relatively short median days on market indicate that well‑priced, attractive homes tend to sell quickly.

### 3.3. Active – Townhouse

For Active Townhouses (n = 54):

**Market View:**

Townhouses bridge the gap between condominiums and single‑family homes. They offer many of the benefits of single‑family residences (like more space and sometimes private outdoor areas) while typically costing less and requiring less maintenance. The relatively short median days on market indicate strong buyer interest.

### 3.4. The Combined Active Market

When all 509 active listings are aggregated:

**Summary for Active Listings:**

Active listings are diverse. Condominiums offer entry points for buyers and investors, single‑family homes provide a broad range of options and price points, and townhouses fill the niche for those seeking a compromise between affordability and space. Buyers who wish to search the current inventory can explore our [Active Listings](/) page.

## 4. Active Under Contract: When Offers Are In

The “Active Under Contract” category (n = 96) represents properties that have received offers and are in the process of moving toward a sale. Although these listings are still considered “active” for marketing purposes, they give us early insight into what buyers are willing to pay.

### 4.1. Condominium Under Contract

For Condominiums Under Contract (n = 28):

**Observations:**

The data indicates that condos under contract in the Active Under Contract category are generally priced in the mid‑$400K to $750K range. They take about two and a half months on average to move into contract status—a signal that while the market is competitive, buyers are still taking their time to secure the right property.

### 4.2. Single Family Residence Under Contract

For Single Family Residences Under Contract (n = 65):

**Analysis:**

The under‑contract single‑family market shows a slight premium compared with active listings overall. The fact that these homes take longer to move into contract status than the active townhouses may be related to the higher price points and more involved negotiations that often come with single‑family properties.

### 4.3. Townhouse Under Contract

For Townhouses Under Contract (n = 3):

**Takeaway:**

Although the sample for townhouses under contract is small, the quick turnaround compared with single‑family homes suggests that townhouses are particularly attractive to buyers in a competitive environment.

### 4.4. Overall Active Under Contract

When all 96 properties are combined:

## 5. Pending Transactions: The Near‑Final Stage

The “Pending” category (n = 129) comprises listings that have accepted offers and are in the final stages of closing. This status provides insight into what buyers are ultimately willing to pay.

### 5.1. Pending – Condominium

For Pending Condominiums (n = 20):

**Insights:**

Pending condos are selling relatively close to their list prices, with moderate days on market. This reinforces the idea that the condominium market is balanced, with offers coming in fairly quickly.

### 5.2. Pending – Single Family Residence

For Pending Single Family Residences (n = 102):

**Analysis:**

The pending single‑family market shows a robust performance, with properties moving to pending status quickly (median of 27 days). This fast pace may be driven by strong buyer interest in well‑priced, desirable neighborhoods.

### 5.3. Pending – Townhouse

For Pending Townhouses (n = 7):

**Observation:**

Pending townhouses have a similar pace to the pending single‑family segment, although the numbers are based on a smaller sample size.

### 5.4. Overall Pending Market

When combining all pending properties (n = 129):

For buyers ready to seal the deal, understanding pending market trends is crucial. To learn more about the final steps in a transaction, check out our Buyers Guide.

## 6. Closed Transactions: Lessons from Final Sales

Closed transactions represent the final, executed sales that give us the most concrete measure of market performance. In our data set, there are 50 closed listings across all property types.

### 6.1. Closed – Condominium

For Closed Condominiums (n = 7):

### 6.2. Closed – Single Family Residence

For Closed Single Family Residences (n = 39):

**What This Means:**

The closed single‑family market is highly competitive. With a fast turnaround and properties selling at full asking price or slightly above, sellers benefit greatly from current demand. Buyers should be prepared for competitive bidding in this segment.

### 6.3. Closed – Townhouse

For Closed Townhouses (n = 4):

**Summary:**

Although the sample size for townhouses is small, closed townhouse data indicates that these properties—often appealing to those wanting a low‑maintenance lifestyle—are selling for what sellers expect in a competitive market.

### 6.4. Overall Closed Data

Combining all closed transactions (n = 50):

**Takeaway:**

Closed transaction data is a powerful indicator of market health. In Santa Clarita, the fact that most properties are closing at or near list price—with relatively short days on market—suggests that demand remains strong across the board.

## 7. Expired Listings: Pricing Lessons

Expired listings (n = 5) are properties that did not sell during the listing period. These cases often offer valuable lessons on overpricing or misaligned marketing strategies.

### Expired – Condominium

For Expired Condominiums (n = 1):

### Expired – Single Family Residence

For Expired Single Family Residences (n = 4):

**Key Lesson:**

When properties expire, it’s often because the asking price did not align with buyer expectations. Sellers should consider a more realistic pricing strategy and perhaps improve marketing efforts before re‑listing.

## 8. Canceled Listings: Adjusting Strategy

Canceled listings (n = 7) are properties that sellers have removed from the market before a sale is finalized. This can happen for many reasons—from changes in seller circumstances to adjustments in market strategy.

### Canceled – Condominium

For Canceled Condominiums (n = 4):

### Canceled – Single Family Residence

For Canceled Single Family Residences (n = 3):

**Overall Canceled Data:**

Canceled listings (n = 7) highlight that even in a strong market, pricing missteps or market timing issues can force sellers to withdraw their property from public view. This is a useful cautionary tale for those considering a listing.

## 9. Hold Status: Properties on Pause

“Hold” listings (n = 31) represent properties that are temporarily removed from the market for various reasons. They may be under renovation, reconsideration, or part of a strategic delay.

### Hold – Condominium

For Hold Condominiums (n = 5):

### Hold – Single Family Residence

For Hold Single Family Residences (n = 25):

### Hold – Townhouse

For Hold Townhouses (n = 1):

**Summary for Hold Listings:**

Overall, hold listings (n = 31) signal that some sellers are taking a temporary step back from the market. For buyers, this may mean that there is potential for price adjustments in the near future. For sellers, it serves as a reminder to ensure that your timing and property presentation are aligned with current market conditions.

## 10. Withdrawn Listings: Reconsidering the Market

Withdrawn listings (n = 43) are properties that were once active but have been pulled from the market by the seller. They can provide insight into how market dynamics or seller expectations shift over time.

### Withdrawn – Condominium

For Withdrawn Condominiums (n = 9):

### Withdrawn – Single Family Residence

For Withdrawn Single Family Residences (n = 29):

### Withdrawn – Townhouse

For Withdrawn Townhouses (n = 5):

### Overall Withdrawn Data

When all withdrawn listings are combined (n = 43):

**Takeaway:**

For both buyers and sellers, withdrawn listings are a reminder that the market is fluid. Sellers may re‑list their properties later at a different price, and buyers might have opportunities to negotiate if a property re‑enters the market.

## 11. Overall Market Data by Status and Type

When we combine data for all statuses (n = 880 properties) by type, we see the following overall picture:

### Overall – Condominium (n = 178)
