# Market Insights by Status and Type: A Comprehensive Analysis

*By your trusted Santa Clarita real estate advisor*

Real estate is not “one size fits all.” Whether you’re a first‑time buyer, a seasoned seller, or an investor looking for your next opportunity, understanding how properties perform across different statuses and types is essential to making smart decisions. In this post, we’ll dive into our latest “Statistics by Status and Type” report—which covers everything from properties that are “Coming Soon” to those that have “Closed” or even been “Withdrawn.” We’ll explore the data for each property type (Condominiums, Single Family Residences, and Townhouses) and explain what these numbers mean for you.

Our discussion will be organized by status. For each status, we’ll review key metrics such as list price, days on market, sale price-to-list price ratios, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, year built, square footage, price per square foot, lot size, and additional features (like carport spaces). Let’s begin by taking a closer look at what these statuses mean in our dynamic Santa Clarita market.

## 1. Introduction

In today’s fast‑paced real estate market, understanding every stage of a listing’s life cycle is key. Our latest data set—“Statistics by Status and Type”—allows us to break down properties by their current status (from “Coming Soon” to “Closed” and everything in between) as well as by property type (Condominium, Single Family Residence, Townhouse). This granular analysis helps you see not only how properties are priced and how quickly they sell but also reveals important trends that can inform your next move.

Whether you’re interested in the upcoming “Coming Soon” listings that haven’t hit the market yet, the properties actively competing in today’s market, or the final sale numbers from closed transactions, this post is designed to provide you with actionable insights. Let’s start with the “Coming Soon” category.

## 2. Coming Soon Properties: A Preview by Type

“Coming Soon” listings are those properties that have not yet officially hit the market. They’re generating buzz and anticipation among buyers and often give us early clues about future market conditions. In our data set, we have 10 “Coming Soon” properties broken down by type.

### 2.1. Condominium – Coming Soon

For “Coming Soon” condominiums (n = 2):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $605,000

		- **Maximum:** $650,000

		- **Average:** $627,500

		- **Median:** $627,500

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** All are recorded as 0 days because they are not yet officially active.

	- **Other Metrics:**
	
		The smaller condominium has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, built in 1970, with 1,162 SqFt and a price per square foot of $427.35.

		- The larger condominium has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, built in 1998, with 1,521 SqFt and a price per square foot of $520.65.

		- Lot sizes range from approximately 171,915 to 573,042 square feet, suggesting that these properties include sizable parcels of land.

	

	

**What Does This Tell Us?**

Coming Soon condominiums in Santa Clarita are positioned in the mid‑$600K range. Although a small sample, the data indicates a moderate increase in size, newer construction on the higher end, and variability in lot size—all factors that may appeal to buyers looking for a low‑maintenance lifestyle combined with outdoor space. For those eager to see what’s about to hit the market, consider setting up alerts on our [Dream Home Finder](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/dream-home-finder) tool.

### 2.2. Single Family Residence – Coming Soon

For “Coming Soon” Single Family Residences (n = 8):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $550,000

		- **Maximum:** $1,499,900

		- **Average:** $1,141,550

		- **Median:** $1,168,500

	

	
	- **Other Key Metrics:**
	
		The smallest home is a 3‑bedroom, 2‑bath built in 1976 with 1,676 SqFt and a price per square foot of $317.18 on a modest lot of 5,510 SqFt.

		- The top‑priced property is a 5‑bedroom, 5‑bath residence built in 2021 boasting 3,827 SqFt with a price per square foot of $433.96 on a large lot of 51,531 SqFt.

	

	

**Analysis:**

The Single Family Residence category in Coming Soon shows a wide price range—from more modest homes to upscale properties nearing $1.5 million. The average price above $1.1 million and median around $1.17 million indicate that the market is gearing up for higher‑end inventory soon. The diversity in sizes, ages, and lot sizes reflects the heterogeneous nature of the Santa Clarita market. Sellers may be positioning these homes strategically ahead of time, while buyers should prepare for a competitive environment once these listings become active.

### 2.3. Overall “Coming Soon” Market

When combining both types (n = 10):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $550,000

		- **Maximum:** $1,499,900

		- **Average:** $1,038,740

		- **Median:** $1,150,000

	

	
	- **Price per SqFt:** The overall average is about $396.34, with a median of $394.45.

	- **Lot Sizes:** Vary widely, from as little as 5,510 SqFt to as large as 573,042 SqFt.

**Key Takeaway:**

The Coming Soon market is hinting at an inventory mix that spans from affordable single‑family homes to high‑end residences, with condominiums clustering in the mid‑range. For buyers and investors, keeping an eye on these Coming Soon listings can provide a head start on negotiating favorable offers.

## 3. Active Listings: The Heartbeat of the Market

Active listings are the properties currently available for sale. They represent the market’s current pulse, reflecting the supply that buyers can immediately choose from. In our data, there are 509 active listings divided into three property types.

### 3.1. Active – Condominium

For Active Condominiums (n = 102):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $229,000

		- **Maximum:** $935,342

		- **Average:** $535,212

		- **Median:** $499,900

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** The average is 70 days, with a median of 60 days.

	- **Property Characteristics:**
	
		Typically 1–2 bedrooms and 1–2 bathrooms, built from as early as 1963 up to recent construction in 2024.

		- Average square footage is around 1,150 SqFt, and the price per square foot averages about $474.52.

		- Lot sizes tend to be small—often represented by a single value in the “Lot SqFt” column, which in some cases is as little as “1” (likely a placeholder for condo associations or minimal land).

	

	

**Market Implications:**

Active condominiums are generally more affordable than single‑family homes, making them attractive to first‑time buyers, downsizers, or investors looking for rental opportunities. The days on market suggest that while these properties are competitive, they might require a slightly longer search period compared to more aggressively priced single‑family homes.

### 3.2. Active – Single Family Residence

For Active Single Family Residences (n = 353):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $328,000

		- **Maximum:** $4,750,000

		- **Average:** $1,105,622

		- **Median:** $950,000

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** The average is 61 days, with the median at 45 days.

	- **Key Data:**
	
		Homes range from modest starter properties (often with 1 bedroom in very old construction) to luxury estates featuring up to 10,227 SqFt and very large lots.

		- The average price per square foot is about $450.75.

	

	

**Insights:**

The Single Family Residence category clearly dominates in volume and value. With such a broad range of prices and sizes, this segment caters to a wide array of buyer needs—from those entering the market to luxury buyers. The relatively short median days on market indicate that well‑priced, attractive homes tend to sell quickly.

### 3.3. Active – Townhouse

For Active Townhouses (n = 54):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $379,900

		- **Maximum:** $950,000

		- **Average:** $654,696

		- **Median:** $658,995

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** The average is 58 days, with the median at 28 days.

	- **Features:**
	
		Townhouses in this category typically have 2–3 bedrooms and 1–3 bathrooms.

		- Their square footage averages around 1,499 SqFt, with a price per square foot averaging about $452.89.

	

	

**Market View:**

Townhouses bridge the gap between condominiums and single‑family homes. They offer many of the benefits of single‑family residences (like more space and sometimes private outdoor areas) while typically costing less and requiring less maintenance. The relatively short median days on market indicate strong buyer interest.

### 3.4. The Combined Active Market

When all 509 active listings are aggregated:

	- **List Price Range:**

	
		**Minimum:** $229,000

		- **Maximum:** $4,750,000

		- **Average:** $943,477

		- **Median:** $839,900

	

	
	- **Price per SqFt:** The overall average is about $455.74, with a median of $440.89.

	- **Volume and Turnover:**
	
		The large volume of active listings (509 properties) and the generally moderate days on market suggest a robust, competitive market.

	

	

**Summary for Active Listings:**

Active listings are diverse. Condominiums offer entry points for buyers and investors, single‑family homes provide a broad range of options and price points, and townhouses fill the niche for those seeking a compromise between affordability and space. Buyers who wish to search the current inventory can explore our [Active Listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings) page.

## 4. Active Under Contract: When Offers Are In

The “Active Under Contract” category (n = 96) represents properties that have received offers and are in the process of moving toward a sale. Although these listings are still considered “active” for marketing purposes, they give us early insight into what buyers are willing to pay.

### 4.1. Condominium Under Contract

For Condominiums Under Contract (n = 28):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $289,000

		- **Maximum:** $750,000

		- **Average:** $481,392

		- **Median:** $447,500

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** The average is 74 days (median 75 days).

	- **Other Data:**
	
		These condos typically have 1–2 bedrooms and 1–2 bathrooms, with average square footage around 1,063 SqFt and a price per square foot of about $460.16.

	

	

**Observations:**

The data indicates that condos under contract in the Active Under Contract category are generally priced in the mid‑$400K to $750K range. They take about two and a half months on average to move into contract status—a signal that while the market is competitive, buyers are still taking their time to secure the right property.

### 4.2. Single Family Residence Under Contract

For Single Family Residences Under Contract (n = 65):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $335,000

		- **Maximum:** $5,099,000

		- **Average:** $1,008,082

		- **Median:** $839,000

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** The average is 83 days (median 67 days).

	- **Key Characteristics:**
	
		Homes under contract vary widely in size and price, indicating that both the entry‑level and luxury segments are active.

		- Average square footage is around 2,253, with a price per square foot near $470.08.

	

	

**Analysis:**

The under‑contract single‑family market shows a slight premium compared with active listings overall. The fact that these homes take longer to move into contract status than the active townhouses may be related to the higher price points and more involved negotiations that often come with single‑family properties.

### 4.3. Townhouse Under Contract

For Townhouses Under Contract (n = 3):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $598,000

		- **Maximum:** $636,000

		- **Average:** $617,667

		- **Median:** $619,000

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** The average is 49 days (median 29 days).

	- **Details:**
	
		Townhouses under contract have modest prices and take roughly one and a half months to reach contract status.

	

	

**Takeaway:**

Although the sample for townhouses under contract is small, the quick turnaround compared with single‑family homes suggests that townhouses are particularly attractive to buyers in a competitive environment.

### 4.4. Overall Active Under Contract

When all 96 properties are combined:

	- **Overall List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $289,000

		- **Maximum:** $5,099,000

		- **Average:** $842,263

		- **Median:** $749,950

	

	
	- **Price per SqFt:** On average, about $466.83, with a median of $448.33.

	- **Market Implication:**
	
		Properties under contract are selling for prices very close to their list prices, which means the market is strong and buyers are often meeting seller expectations.

	

	

For a closer look at properties that are almost off the market, our [Active Under Contract](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings) section is updated regularly.

## 5. Pending Transactions: The Near‑Final Stage

The “Pending” category (n = 129) comprises listings that have accepted offers and are in the final stages of closing. This status provides insight into what buyers are ultimately willing to pay.

### 5.1. Pending – Condominium

For Pending Condominiums (n = 20):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $345,999

		- **Maximum:** $909,990

		- **Median:** $475,000

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** The average is 69 days (median 53 days).

	- **Property Details:**

Pending condos are selling relatively close to their list prices, with moderate days on market. This reinforces the idea that the condominium market is balanced, with offers coming in fairly quickly.

### 5.2. Pending – Single Family Residence

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $153,900

		- **Maximum:** $1,969,995

		- **Average:** $970,252

		- **Median:** $889,500

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** The average is 54 days (median 27 days).

	- **Key Data:**
	
		These pending homes generally have around 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, with an average square footage of about 2,291 and a price per square foot near $449.24.

	

	

**Analysis:**

The pending single‑family market shows a robust performance, with properties moving to pending status quickly (median of 27 days). This fast pace may be driven by strong buyer interest in well‑priced, desirable neighborhoods.

### 5.3. Pending – Townhouse

For Pending Townhouses (n = 7):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $520,000

		- **Maximum:** $935,000

		- **Average:** $687,029

		- **Median:** $660,000

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** The average is 55 days (median 54 days).

	- **Additional Data:**
	
		Townhouses pending sale average around 1,687 SqFt, with a price per square foot of approximately $412.06.

	

	

**Observation:**

Pending townhouses have a similar pace to the pending single‑family segment, although the numbers are based on a smaller sample size.

### 5.4. Overall Pending Market

When combining all pending properties (n = 129):

	- **Overall List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $345,999

		- **Maximum:** $909,990 for condos and up to $1,969,995 for single‑family residences

		- **Average:** $885,927

		- **Median:** $849,000

	

	
	- **Price per SqFt:** The overall average is around $447.25, with a median of $427.83.

	- **Conclusion:**
	
		Pending listings are moving quickly and selling for prices very near to their asking prices. This signals that the market is efficient and competitive at the point of sale.

## 6. Closed Transactions: Lessons from Final Sales

Closed transactions represent the final, executed sales that give us the most concrete measure of market performance. In our data set, there are 50 closed listings across all property types.

### 6.1. Closed – Condominium

For Closed Condominiums (n = 7):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $379,900

		- **Maximum:** $769,000

		- **Average:** $596,954

		- **Median:** $549,900

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** The average is 60 days (median 42 days).

	- **Sale Price Data:**
	
		The average closed sale price is around $588,983, with an SP/LP ratio of roughly 98.8%.

	

	
	- **Implications:**
	
		Condos are selling for nearly what they are listed for, which shows a stable market. The days on market indicate that well‑priced condominiums can be expected to close within about two months.

	

	

### 6.2. Closed – Single Family Residence

For Closed Single Family Residences (n = 39):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $560,000

		- **Maximum:** $1,600,000

		- **Average:** $904,245

		- **Median:** $850,000

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** The average is 40 days (median 29 days).

	- **Key Data:**
	
		These properties average about 2,115 SqFt with a price per square foot of roughly $464.82.

		- The SP/LP ratio is very close to 100% (100.4% on average), meaning properties are selling at or above the list price.

	

	

**What This Means:**

The closed single‑family market is highly competitive. With a fast turnaround and properties selling at full asking price or slightly above, sellers benefit greatly from current demand. Buyers should be prepared for competitive bidding in this segment.

### 6.3. Closed – Townhouse

For Closed Townhouses (n = 4):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $571,000

		- **Maximum:** $699,999

		- **Average:** $632,725

		- **Median:** $629,950

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** The average is 96 days (median 96 days).

	- **Additional Metrics:**
	
		Townhouses average around 1,286 SqFt and a price per square foot of approximately $503.01.

		- The SP/LP ratio is around 100%, indicating that offers are meeting the listing expectations.

	

	

**Summary:**

Although the sample size for townhouses is small, closed townhouse data indicates that these properties—often appealing to those wanting a low‑maintenance lifestyle—are selling for what sellers expect in a competitive market.

### 6.4. Overall Closed Data

Combining all closed transactions (n = 50):

	- **Overall List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $379,900

		- **Maximum:** $1,600,000

		- **Average:** $839,503

		- **Median:** $779,450

	

	
	- **Overall Days on Market:** The average is 47 days (median 33 days).

	- **Overall Price per SqFt:** The overall average is about $468.86, with a median of $473.06.

	- **SP/LP Ratio:** At or near 100%, indicating that sales are generally meeting seller expectations.

**Takeaway:**

Closed transaction data is a powerful indicator of market health. In Santa Clarita, the fact that most properties are closing at or near list price—with relatively short days on market—suggests that demand remains strong across the board.

## 7. Expired Listings: Pricing Lessons

Expired listings (n = 5) are properties that did not sell during the listing period. These cases often offer valuable lessons on overpricing or misaligned marketing strategies.

### Expired – Condominium

For Expired Condominiums (n = 1):

	- **List Price:** $399,777

	- **Days on Market:** 152 days

	- **Property Details:**
	
		A 2‑bedroom, 2‑bath condominium built in 1984 with 860 SqFt and a price per square foot of $464.86.

		- The lot size is 180,056 SqFt, which is unusually high for a condo and might have influenced buyer perception.

	

	

### Expired – Single Family Residence

For Expired Single Family Residences (n = 4):

	- **List Price Range:**

	
		**Minimum:** $725,000

		- **Maximum:** $1,050,000

		- **Average:** $903,498

		- **Median:** $919,495

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** The average is 175 days (median 78 days).

	- **Observations:**
	
		Homes that remain on the market for longer periods may indicate that the listing price was too aggressive or that the property did not match current buyer preferences.

	

	

**Key Lesson:**

When properties expire, it’s often because the asking price did not align with buyer expectations. Sellers should consider a more realistic pricing strategy and perhaps improve marketing efforts before re‑listing.

## 8. Canceled Listings: Adjusting Strategy

Canceled listings (n = 7) are properties that sellers have removed from the market before a sale is finalized. This can happen for many reasons—from changes in seller circumstances to adjustments in market strategy.

### Canceled – Condominium

For Canceled Condominiums (n = 4):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $389,870

		- **Maximum:** $724,900

		- **Average:** $538,168

		- **Median:** $518,950

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** The average is 66–244 days (the median is 123 days).

	- **Insights:**
	
		The wide range in days on market suggests that some condos may have been removed quickly due to a change in pricing strategy, while others lingered for months without generating sufficient buyer interest.

	

	

### Canceled – Single Family Residence

For Canceled Single Family Residences (n = 3):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $1,115,000

		- **Maximum:** $2,100,000

		- **Average:** $1,471,667

		- **Median:** $1,200,000

	

	
	- **Observations:**
	
		Higher‑priced single‑family homes that do not sell quickly may prompt sellers to cancel the listing and re‑evaluate the market.

	

	

**Overall Canceled Data:**

Canceled listings (n = 7) highlight that even in a strong market, pricing missteps or market timing issues can force sellers to withdraw their property from public view. This is a useful cautionary tale for those considering a listing.

## 9. Hold Status: Properties on Pause

“Hold” listings (n = 31) represent properties that are temporarily removed from the market for various reasons. They may be under renovation, reconsideration, or part of a strategic delay.

### Hold – Condominium

For Hold Condominiums (n = 5):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $345,999

		- **Maximum:** $580,000

		- **Average:** $476,200

		- **Median:** $490,000

	

	
	- **Other Metrics:**
	
		These properties have very short days on market (averaging 17 days), suggesting that the hold status is not due to market sluggishness but rather seller decision-making.

	

	

### Hold – Single Family Residence

For Hold Single Family Residences (n = 25):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $450,000

		- **Maximum:** $2,198,800

		- **Average:** $943,108

		- **Median:** $874,999

	

	
	- **Days on Market:** Averaging 59 days (median 50 days).

	- **Observations:**
	
		Properties on hold represent a strategic pause—sellers might be waiting for market conditions to improve or for renovations to be completed before re‑listing.

	

	

### Hold – Townhouse

For Hold Townhouses (n = 1):

	- **Data:**

	
		The single townhouse on hold is listed at $545,000 with 102 days on market.

	

	

**Summary for Hold Listings:**

Overall, hold listings (n = 31) signal that some sellers are taking a temporary step back from the market. For buyers, this may mean that there is potential for price adjustments in the near future. For sellers, it serves as a reminder to ensure that your timing and property presentation are aligned with current market conditions.

## 10. Withdrawn Listings: Reconsidering the Market

Withdrawn listings (n = 43) are properties that were once active but have been pulled from the market by the seller. They can provide insight into how market dynamics or seller expectations shift over time.

### Withdrawn – Condominium

For Withdrawn Condominiums (n = 9):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $345,000

		- **Maximum:** $640,000

		- **Average:** $475,556

		- **Median:** $499,000

	

	
	- **Key Points:**
	
		Withdrawn condos typically have moderate days on market (averaging 41 days). Sellers may withdraw their listings if the market shifts or if they reconsider their pricing strategy.

	

	

### Withdrawn – Single Family Residence

For Withdrawn Single Family Residences (n = 29):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $639,000

		- **Maximum:** $2,450,000

		- **Average:** $1,042,286

		- **Median:** $950,000

	

	
	- **Additional Data:**
	
		These homes show an average price per square foot of around $465.36, and many sellers may withdraw if the home does not generate the anticipated interest.

	

	

### Withdrawn – Townhouse

For Withdrawn Townhouses (n = 5):

	- **List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $379,900

		- **Maximum:** $935,000

		- **Average:** $687,029

		- **Median:** $660,000

	

	
	- **Observations:**
	
		The townhouse data for withdrawn listings is similar to that of pending and active townhouse listings—suggesting that withdrawals here may be more about timing than pricing errors.

	

	

### Overall Withdrawn Data

When all withdrawn listings are combined (n = 43):

	- **Overall List Price:**

	
		**Minimum:** $345,000

		- **Maximum:** $1,050,000

		- **Average:** Approximately $802,753

		- **Median:** $869,000

	

	
	- **Implications:**
	
		Withdrawn listings show that some sellers are re‑evaluating their options, either due to shifting market conditions or personal circumstances.

	

	

**Takeaway:**

For both buyers and sellers, withdrawn listings are a reminder that the market is fluid. Sellers may re‑list their properties later at a different price, and buyers might have opportunities to negotiate if a property re‑enters the market.

## 12. Tips and Recommendations for Buyers, Sellers, and Investors

Based on these statistics segmented by status and type, here are some actionable tips:

### For Buyers

	- **Understand the Status:**

	
		*Coming Soon* listings give you early insight. Consider signing up for alerts so you’re among the first to see these properties.

		- In the *Active* and *Active Under Contract* markets, act quickly—properties, especially condominiums and townhouses, may move within 60 days or less.

	

	
	- **Know Your Property Type:**
	
		Condos offer a lower entry price and may be ideal if you’re a first‑time buyer or investor.

		- Single Family Residences are ideal for families and those looking for more space.

		- Townhouses can offer a good balance between affordability and space.

	

	
	- **Negotiate with Data:**
	
		Use our [Free Market Analysis](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/free-market-analysis) tool to see how similar properties are priced and what they have sold for.

		- Keep an eye on the SP/LP ratios: when these are near or above 100%, you may need to act fast and be prepared for competitive bidding.

	

	

### For Sellers

	- **Price Competitively:**

	
		Data from the *Closed* and *Pending* categories shows that well‑priced properties move quickly and often close at or above list price.

		- Avoid overpricing, as shown by the properties in the *Expired* and *Canceled* categories, which often linger on the market.

	

	
	- **Enhance Your Listing:**
	
		High‑quality photos, detailed descriptions, and even virtual tours (see our [Dream Home Finder](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/dream-home-finder)) can make a significant difference.

	

	
	- **Stay Flexible:**
	
		If your property goes on hold or is withdrawn, use the extra time to re‑evaluate your strategy. Consulting our [Sellers Guide](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/sellers-guide) might offer additional insights.

	

	
	- **Monitor Market Trends:**
	
		Regularly review our market updates and consider reaching out via our [Contact](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/contact) page for personalized advice.

	

	

### For Investors

	- **Diverse Inventory:**

	
		The market’s broad range—from condominiums under $300K to multi‑million dollar single‑family residences—offers opportunities for various investment strategies.

	

	
	- **Look for Quick Turnover:**
	
		Areas with low median days on market (such as some segments of the Active or Pending categories) are indications of strong demand.

	

	
	- **Use Data to Identify Value:**
	
		Compare properties that have expired or been canceled to identify potentially undervalued assets.

	

	
	- **Stay Informed:**
	
		Regularly review our statistics by status and type, and subscribe to our [Newsletter](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/newsletter) for the latest market trends.
