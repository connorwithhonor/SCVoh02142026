Whether you're buying or selling, understanding recent trends can make all the difference. Here's a detailed breakdown of Valencia's real estate activity over the past 30 days, helping you make informed decisions.

#### **Market Activity: A Healthy and Balanced Market**

In the past 30 days, Valencia has demonstrated a healthy balance between buyer demand and inventory availability. Homes sold in an&nbsp;**average of 30 days**, showing steady interest. The fastest sale occurred in just&nbsp;**seven days**, likely a cash deal where contingencies were waived. For both buyers and sellers, this pace highlights the importance of preparation and strategic planning.

#### **Sale Prices: A Competitive Range**

	- **Average Sale Price:**&nbsp;$693,898

	- **Price Range:**&nbsp;$612,500 to $765,000

Homes at the higher end of this range often featured&nbsp;**larger lot sizes**&nbsp;or&nbsp;**newer construction**, catering to buyers seeking modern amenities or outdoor space. This variety ensures something for everyone in Valencia, whether you're a first-time buyer or a seasoned investor.

#### **Financing Trends: Conventional Loans Lead**

Most buyers in Valencia chose&nbsp;**conventional loans**, favored for their straightforward approval process.&nbsp;**FHA loans**&nbsp;were also utilized, particularly by budget-conscious buyers targeting mid-to-lower price ranges. Sellers often preferred conventional financing due to its reliability and quicker turnaround.

#### **Property Characteristics: Diverse Options**

Valencia homes sold over the past month showcased a blend of&nbsp;**modern and classic styles**:

	- **Age of Homes:**&nbsp;Ranged from well-maintained older builds (2004) to newer constructions (2022–2024).

	- **Lot Sizes:**&nbsp;Varied significantly, with smaller lots starting at&nbsp;**0.74 acres**&nbsp;and larger properties exceeding&nbsp;**3 acres**.

	- **Zoning:**&nbsp;Primarily classified as residential (e.g.,&nbsp;**SCSP, LCA25**), supporting a family-friendly community vibe.

This diversity ensures options for buyers seeking move-in-ready properties, spacious lots, or energy-efficient designs.

#### **Buyer Insights: Tips for Success**

	- **Act Fast:**&nbsp;Homes with&nbsp;**strong curb appeal**&nbsp;and competitive pricing sold quickly, so be prepared with&nbsp;**pre-approval letters**.

	- **Prioritize Features:**&nbsp;Look for&nbsp;**energy-efficient designs**&nbsp;or&nbsp;**modern amenities**&nbsp;to enhance long-term value.

	- **Plan for Financing:**&nbsp;While conventional loans dominate, FHA options are viable for mid-tier properties. Ensure your finances are in order to make competitive offers.

#### **Seller Insights: Maximize Your Sale**

	- **Strategic Pricing:**&nbsp;Homes priced appropriately for the market sold within&nbsp;**30 days**. Avoid overpricing to prevent extended listing times.

	- **Highlight Features:**&nbsp;Larger lots and newer construction attracted higher offers, so emphasize these in your marketing.

	- **Preferred Financing:**&nbsp;Conventional financing remains the preferred method among sellers due to its reliability.

#### **Key Takeaways for Buyers and Sellers**
