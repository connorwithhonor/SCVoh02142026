**INTRODUCTION**

So you're thinking about buying a home in Santa Clarita. Maybe you've been browsing Zillow, checking out open houses, or talking to lenders about pre-approval. And you've probably landed on a price range—let's say $700,000 to $900,000 for a solid family home in Valencia or Saugus.

But here's what most first-time buyers (and even some repeat buyers) don't realize: **the purchase price is just the beginning**.

I'm Connor MacIvor, and I've been deep in the Santa Clarita real estate trenches since 1998—27 years of helping buyers navigate everything from starter condos to luxury estates. Before that, I spent 20 years with LAPD, so trust me, I've seen people try to cut corners and I've seen the consequences.

Here's the reality: buying a home in Santa Clarita in 2026 involves costs most people don't budget for until they're sitting at the closing table with sweaty palms and a sinking feeling in their gut.

This article breaks down **every single cost**—from the obvious (down payment) to the sneaky (transfer taxes, HOA capital assessments, and that thing called "impounds" that nobody explains properly).

If you want to buy smart, keep reading. If you want to avoid financial surprises that could derail your purchase, keep reading. And if you're working with an agent who hasn't walked you through all of this yet, you might want to reconsider who you're working with.

Let's get into it.

**THE OBVIOUS COST: YOUR DOWN PAYMENT**

Let's start with what everyone knows about: the down payment.

For most conventional loans in Santa Clarita, you're looking at:

	- **20% down** = No PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance), better rates, stronger offers

	- **10-15% down** = PMI required, slightly higher rates, still competitive

	- **5% down** = Higher PMI, higher rates, but gets you in the game

	- **3% down** = First-time buyer programs, FHA, higher costs long-term

**Example:**

$800,000 home purchase:

	- 20% down = $160,000

	- 10% down = $80,000

	- 5% down = $40,000

	- 3% down = $24,000

Most Santa Clarita buyers I work with aim for 10-20% down. Anything less and you're competing with stronger offers in this market, especially in desirable neighborhoods like Valencia Westridge, Stevenson Ranch, or West Creek.

But here's the kicker: **that down payment is just the entry fee**. You've got a whole lineup of other costs coming at you.

**CLOSING COSTS: THE $15,000-$25,000 YOU DIDN'T BUDGET FOR**

Closing costs in Santa Clarita typically run **2-3% of the purchase price**. On an $800,000 home, that's $16,000 to $24,000.

Here's the breakdown:

**1. Loan Origination Fees**

Your lender charges you to process your loan. Typically 0.5-1% of the loan amount.

	- $800K home, $640K loan (20% down) = $3,200-$6,400

**2. Appraisal Fee**

Required by your lender. In Santa Clarita, expect $500-$800.

**3. Home Inspection**

Not required, but you're insane if you skip it. $400-$700 depending on home size and age.

**4. Title Insurance**

Protects you and your lender if there's a title dispute. In California, buyers typically pay for the lender's title policy. $1,000-$2,500 depending on purchase price.

**5. Escrow Fees**

The neutral third party handling your transaction. Split between buyer and seller in many cases, but budget $1,500-$3,000 for your portion.

**6. Recording Fees**

Paid to Los Angeles County to record your deed. Usually $200-$500.

**7. HOA Transfer Fees**

If you're buying in a community with an HOA (most of Valencia, Stevenson Ranch, parts of Canyon Country), expect $200-$800 in HOA document prep and transfer fees.

**8. Property Taxes (Prorated)**

You'll pay your share of property taxes from the date you close to the end of the tax period. Varies depending on closing date.

**9. Homeowners Insurance (First Year Premium)**

Required by your lender. In Santa Clarita, expect $1,200-$2,500/year depending on home value, location, and coverage.

**10. HOA Dues (Prorated)**

If your home has HOA dues, you'll pay from closing date through the end of the month/quarter. Valencia HOAs range from $50-$300/month depending on amenities.

**TOTAL ESTIMATED CLOSING COSTS ON AN $800K HOME:**

**$16,000 - $24,000**

And here's the thing: some of these you can negotiate with the seller to cover (especially in a buyer's market), but in 2026, Santa Clarita is still competitive enough that most sellers aren't offering closing cost credits unless the home's been sitting for 30+ days.

**IMPOUNDS (ESCROW ACCOUNTS): THE $5,000-$10,000 YOUR LENDER HOLDS HOSTAGE**

This is the one that surprises people the most.

When you close on your home, your lender may require you to set up an **impound (escrow) account** to cover future property taxes and insurance. Basically, they don't trust you to pay those bills on time, so they collect the money from you monthly and pay it themselves.

Here's what you'll prepay at closing:

**Property Taxes:**

Your lender will collect 2-6 months of property taxes upfront to ensure there's always a cushion in your escrow account.

	- $800K home = ~$8,000/year property taxes = $667/month

	- Lender collects 3 months upfront = $2,000

**Homeowners Insurance:**

Your lender will collect 2-3 months of insurance premiums upfront.

	- $1,500/year insurance = $125/month

	- Lender collects 2 months upfront = $250

**HOA Dues (if applicable):**

Some lenders impound HOA dues, some don't. If yours does, add another 2-3 months upfront.

	- $150/month HOA = $300-$450 upfront

**TOTAL IMPOUND COSTS AT CLOSING:**

**$2,500 - $5,000+**

And remember: this is ON TOP of your down payment and closing costs.

**PROPERTY TAXES: THE ANNUAL $8,000-$12,000 BILL**

California property taxes are based on your purchase price, not the previous owner's assessed value. Thanks to Prop 13, your property taxes are capped at **1% of the purchase price plus local assessments** (Mello-Roos, school bonds, etc.).

In Santa Clarita, total property tax rates range from **1.1% to 1.3%** depending on neighborhood.

**Example:**

$800,000 home:

	- Base tax (1%) = $8,000/year

	- Mello-Roos/assessments (0.1-0.3%) = $800-$2,400/year

	- **TOTAL: $8,800 - $10,400/year**

That's $733 - $867/month.

And here's what many buyers don't realize: **Mello-Roos doesn't go away**. It's a special tax used to fund infrastructure in newer neighborhoods (like Valencia, Stevenson Ranch, parts of Castaic). It typically lasts 20-40 years, and it's ON TOP of your base property tax.

Older neighborhoods (Saugus, Canyon Country, Newhall) usually don't have Mello-Roos, so your property taxes are lower. But the homes are older and may require more maintenance.

Trade-offs.

**HOA FEES: THE $50-$400/MONTH YOU'LL PAY FOREVER**

If you're buying in a planned community (most of Valencia, Stevenson Ranch, parts of Castaic), you're paying HOA dues.

**Typical Santa Clarita HOA Fees:**

	- Basic HOA (landscaping, common area maintenance): $50-$150/month

	- Mid-tier HOA (pool, parks, clubhouse): $150-$250/month

	- Premium HOA (multiple pools, gyms, events, gated entry): $250-$400/month

**Annual cost:** $600 - $4,800/year

And here's the kicker: **HOAs can (and do) raise dues**. Budget for a 3-5% annual increase.

Also, some HOAs have **special assessments**—one-time fees to cover major repairs (roof replacement on clubhouse, repaving streets, pool resurfacing). These can be $1,000-$10,000+ and usually come with 30 days' notice.

Fun times.

**HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE: THE $1,200-$3,000/YEAR YOU CAN'T SKIP**

Your lender requires homeowners insurance. In Santa Clarita, rates vary based on:

	- Home value

	- Age of home

	- Fire risk zone (parts of Castaic, Sand Canyon, and northern areas have higher fire risk)

	- Deductible amount

	- Coverage limits

**Typical Santa Clarita insurance costs:**

	- $700K home, standard coverage: $1,200-$1,800/year

	- $1M+ home, standard coverage: $2,000-$3,000/year

	- High fire-risk zones: Add 20-50% to premiums

And if you're in a high-fire-risk area, you might need **additional fire insurance** through California FAIR Plan, which can add another $1,000-$2,000/year.

**MAINTENANCE &amp; REPAIRS: THE $3,000-$10,000/YEAR NOBODY BUDGETS FOR**

Owning a home in Santa Clarita means maintaining a home in Santa Clarita. And stuff breaks.

**Annual maintenance costs (conservative estimate):**

	- HVAC servicing: $150-$300/year

	- Landscaping (if not covered by HOA): $1,200-$3,600/year

	- Pest control: $300-$600/year

	- Pool maintenance (if applicable): $1,200-$2,400/year

	- General repairs (plumbing, electrical, appliances): $1,000-$3,000/year

**Total: $3,000 - $10,000/year**

And that's assuming nothing major breaks. Need a new HVAC system? $8,000-$15,000. Roof replacement? $15,000-$30,000. Water heater? $1,500-$3,000.

Budget 1-2% of your home's value annually for maintenance and repairs. On an $800K home, that's $8,000-$16,000/year.

**UTILITIES: THE $300-$600/MONTH YOU'LL PAY YEAR-ROUND**

Santa Clarita utilities (electricity, gas, water, trash, internet) typically run:

	- Electricity (SCE): $150-$300/month (higher in summer with AC)

	- Gas (SoCalGas): $30-$80/month (higher in winter with heat)

	- Water/trash (varies by city): $80-$150/month

	- Internet/cable: $60-$150/month

**Total: $320 - $680/month**

And if you've got a pool, add another $50-$100/month in water and electricity.

**MOVING COSTS: THE $1,000-$5,000 ONE-TIME HIT**

Don't forget the cost of actually moving into your new home:

	- Professional movers (local): $800-$2,500

	- Moving truck rental (DIY): $150-$500

	- Packing supplies: $100-$300

	- Cleaning (old and new home): $200-$600

	- Immediate repairs/upgrades (paint, fixtures, etc.): $500-$3,000

**Total: $1,750 - $6,900**

**THE REAL TOTAL: WHAT YOU ACTUALLY NEED**

Let's add it all up for an **$800,000 home purchase in Santa Clarita in 2026:**

**UPFRONT COSTS (CLOSING):**

	- Down payment (20%): $160,000

	- Closing costs: $20,000

	- Impounds: $3,500

	- Moving costs: $3,000

	- **TOTAL UPFRONT: $186,500**

**ONGOING MONTHLY COSTS:**

	- Mortgage payment (P&amp;I): $3,825/month

	- Property taxes: $850/month

	- HOA dues: $200/month

	- Homeowners insurance: $150/month

	- Utilities: $450/month

	- Maintenance reserve: $500/month

	- **TOTAL MONTHLY: $5,975/month**

**That's $71,700/year in housing costs.**

And that assumes nothing major breaks and you're not paying for pool service, landscaping, or other extras.

**WHAT MOST AGENTS WON'T TELL YOU**

Here's the part where I separate myself from 90% of agents out there:

**Most agents will qualify you based on your mortgage payment alone.** They'll say "You're approved for $800K!" and send you shopping.

But they won't walk through the **total cost of ownership**. They won't show you that your $3,825/month mortgage payment becomes a $6,000/month housing expense when you add in taxes, insurance, HOA, utilities, and maintenance.

Why? Because if they did, you might realize you can't actually afford that $800K house—and they lose the commission.

I don't work that way. I'm not representing buyers anymore—I run a referral service that connects buyers with the RIGHT agent for their specific situation. And part of that is making sure you understand what you're actually signing up for.

If you're buying in Santa Clarita, you need an agent who:

	- Walks you through the total cost breakdown BEFORE you start shopping

	- Helps you understand neighborhood-specific costs (Mello-Roos, HOA structures, etc.)

	- Negotiates closing cost credits when possible

	- Knows which lenders offer the best terms for your situation

	- Doesn't just qualify you for the MAX—they help you buy what you can COMFORTABLY afford

That's the kind of agent I refer to. Not the ones who just want to close deals.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

Buying a home in Santa Clarita in 2026 is still a smart move—if you go in with your eyes open.

Yes, it's expensive. Yes, there are hidden costs. Yes, you'll need more cash than you think.

But this is also one of the best places to live in Southern California. Great schools, low crime, family-friendly, and still (relatively) affordable compared to coastal markets.

Just don't walk into this blind.

If you're ready to buy and want to work with an agent who'll be straight with you about costs, timelines, and what it really takes to win in this market, reach out. I'll match you with someone who knows their stuff and won't BS you.

**No referral fees. No conflicts of interest. Just honest guidance and a vetted agent who'll treat you right.**

Because at the end of the day, buying a home is the biggest financial decision most people make. You deserve someone who respects that.
