#### Introduction

Welcome to the **Stevenson Ranch Real Estate Market Update**! Today is **December 3rd, 2024**, the **337th day** of the year, and we're in the **49th week** of the year. This update is designed to provide valuable insights for home buyers, sellers, and investors in the Stevenson Ranch area, one of the most desirable locations in the Santa Clarita Valley.

Stevenson Ranch, with its family-friendly neighborhoods, top-rated schools, and proximity to Los Angeles, remains a highly sought-after market. In this report, we will cover:

	- Current market data for Stevenson Ranch.

	- Active listings and property types.

	- Buyer and seller strategies for year-end transactions.

	- Key tips to navigate the current market conditions.

#### Current Market Snapshot

As of today, the **Stevenson Ranch real estate market** includes:

	- **Total Active Listings:** 24

	
		**Single-Family Homes:** 14

		- **Condominiums:** 5

		- **Townhomes:** 5

	

	

This balanced mix of property types ensures that buyers have a variety of choices, whether they are looking for low-maintenance condos or spacious single-family homes.

#### Nationwide Real Estate Trends Impacting Stevenson Ranch

Interest rates remain a critical factor in the current real estate market. Although the Federal Reserve has kept rates stable recently, any future changes could impact buyer affordability and market activity in Stevenson Ranch. Here's what you need to know:

	- **Ten-Year Treasury Yield:** This is the benchmark to watch for mortgage rate fluctuations. Stay informed about its trends for a better understanding of long-term affordability.

	- **Mortgage Interest Deduction:** If you’re a buyer, consult your CPA to learn how this could benefit you, especially if you’re transitioning from renting to owning.

#### Seller Concessions and Dual Agency Concerns

Sellers in Stevenson Ranch have been increasingly offering concessions to attract buyers. These may include:

	- Closing cost credits.

	- Interest rate buydowns.

	- Repairs or upgrades as part of negotiations.

However, a critical aspect of selling in California is the issue of **dual agency**, where the same agent represents both buyer and seller. While legal in California, dual agency often creates conflicts of interest. As a seller, hiring a dedicated agent ensures that your interests are fully represented during negotiations. As a buyer, having your own agent means you have a dedicated advocate to fight for the best terms.

#### Year-End Buying and Selling Tips

**For Buyers:**

	- **Cash Offers:** If you're considering a cash purchase, ensure that your contract includes a firm closing date before December 31st. Many sellers are motivated to close before the year ends for tax purposes.

	- **Financed Offers:** FHA, VA, and conventional loans are still viable but may face delays due to holiday schedules and lender availability. Work closely with your lender to confirm they can meet your desired timeline.

	- **Use Comparable Sales:** When submitting an offer, support your price with recent comparable sales to avoid offending sellers and increase the likelihood of acceptance.

**For Sellers:**

	- **Take Advantage of Low Competition:** With fewer listings on the market, sellers currently face less competition than they will in spring. This is the time to stand out and attract serious buyers.

	- **Strategic Pricing:** Homes that are priced correctly sell faster and closer to the asking price. Consult with your agent to review the most recent comparable sales.

	- **Evaluate Offers Carefully:** A well-supported offer, even if slightly below your asking price, might be worth accepting in today's market.

#### Highlights of Active Listings

The active listings in Stevenson Ranch cover a wide price range and property types. Here are some examples:

	- 
	**Single-Family Homes:**

	
		Spacious layouts with modern amenities.

		- Proximity to award-winning schools and parks.

	

	
	- 
	**Condos and Townhomes:**

	
		Affordable entry points for first-time buyers.

		- Maintenance-free living with community perks.

	

	

Stevenson Ranch's Diamond Head development offers unique townhome configurations where most units provide garage entry or ground-level access, adding convenience for residents.

Whether you’re buying or selling, having a skilled negotiator on your side is crucial. As your first responder realtor, I bring years of experience in high-stakes situations to help you achieve your real estate goals. Think of it as hiring a security consultant for your biggest financial decision.

#### Real Estate in 2025: What's Ahead?

	- **Inventory Growth:** As we approach spring, we anticipate an influx of new listings, which could create more competition for sellers and more opportunities for buyers.

	- **Interest Rate Trends:** The Federal Reserve’s next moves will likely shape buyer demand and affordability.

	- **Updated Resources:** My real estate book, updated for 2025, is a comprehensive guide for buyers and sellers in the Santa Clarita Valley. You can find it at [Santa Clarita Open Houses](https://santaclaritaopenhouses.com/book).
