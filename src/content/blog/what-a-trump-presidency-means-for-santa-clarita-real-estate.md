In today’s fast-evolving market, we are in the midst of significant shifts that affect every home buyer, seller, and investor in the Santa Clarita Valley and Greater Los Angeles. As of today, I’m working with an astonishing 527 active residential listings across Santa Clarita that need to move by the end of the year. If you’re watching this, you may wonder what the impact of a Trump presidency means for local real estate, especially considering the historical context of economic policies under previous administrations. Today, I’ll break down why waiting to buy or sell could be one of the most costly decisions in this dynamic landscape.

### Buyer Confidence Is Soaring with Lower Interest Rates on the Horizon

The recent presidential election has had immediate reverberations in the financial markets. With President Trump poised to take office again in January, there’s renewed optimism about favorable mortgage rates. As the dust settles on this election, confidence in decreasing interest rates is rising, and that optimism isn’t just fluff—it’s grounded in historical trends. Under prior Trump policies, we saw a propensity toward easing regulations and supporting policies aimed at stimulating growth, which may likely lead to financial institutions offering more attractive rates to home buyers.

#### Why Mortgage Rates May Drop

The previous Trump administration supported lower taxes and reduced regulations, which facilitated market liquidity and created incentives for real estate investments. The return of these economic policies could further drive down mortgage rates, making it easier for people to afford homes. For those familiar with how mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are influenced by policy, the outlook of reduced government intervention in mortgage rates means potential rate reductions that could soon trickle down to eager home buyers in Santa Clarita and beyond.

With this expectation of lower rates, competition will intensify, and we’re likely to see buyer activity surge, driving up both the demand and prices in the area. Santa Clarita is already a highly desirable place to live, and the pressure on the inventory will only increase as these expectations unfold. The takeaway for buyers? Act now to lock in favorable deals before the competition heats up, knowing that refinancing options could be available in the future as rates continue their anticipated drop.

### Santa Clarita Real Estate Will See Increased Sales Velocity

In the first responder world, acting decisively is critical, and the same holds true in real estate. As “Connor with Honor,” I leverage my 20+ years in LAPD and my real estate expertise since 1998 to guide buyers and sellers with integrity, precision, and insight. And in today’s post-election real estate market, being prepared means everything.

Santa Clarita, known for its family-friendly environment, top-notch schools, and scenic vistas, is seeing a significant shift in inventory and demand post-election. I’m currently handling 527 active listings across this sought-after region, with homes spanning neighborhoods from Valencia to Newhall. Each of these listings is available on my website, [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com), where you can explore your dream home without the hassle of spam or unsolicited contact.

With a Trump presidency, the financial policies that favor sellers are back in play, and I expect to see listings flying off the market as more buyers flock to grab properties before rates climb back up. If you're thinking of selling, consider this a green light—Santa Clarita homes will likely move faster, and bidding wars may return. As a seller, this is your moment to capitalize on the market’s pace and heightened buyer interest.

### Full Seller’s Market Will Return to Santa Clarita

Right now, we’re in what you could call a "slower seller’s market"—homes are selling, but the pace is measured. With the recent election, however, that pace will shift. Santa Clarita real estate will likely transition back to a *full seller’s market*, one where demand exceeds available homes and competition among buyers intensifies.

In a full seller’s market, you can expect quicker sales, multiple offers, and, in some cases, bidding wars that push prices above asking. With the anticipated drop in interest rates, this scenario is not far off. Homeowners considering selling in 2024 will have an ideal opportunity to maximize their return as the market pivots back into high demand. As your “First Responder Realtor,” I’m here to ensure that your transaction is smooth, efficient, and that you achieve the highest possible value for your home.

### Why Waiting Could Mean Missing Out in Santa Clarita

Timing is critical in real estate, just as it is in first response. Delaying your decision to buy now could mean facing an uphill battle in the future. While some buyers may hold off, hoping for further clarity in the market, the current calm offers an exceptional opportunity to secure a property before demand skyrockets.

**Fact Check**: With 54 new listings and 61 price adjustments just this past week, the market is fluid and adapting. However, the influx of buyers who want to seize the opportunity at potentially favorable rates will likely outpace this inventory. A similar phenomenon occurred after the 2016 election, where buyer demand surged, driving up prices in key regions. Those who bought early in 2017 benefitted greatly from appreciation.

### Seller’s Market is Poised to Return to Santa Clarita

A faster market isn't just about lower rates; it’s also about seller advantages. For homeowners looking to sell, a Trump presidency suggests a resurgence in confidence among sellers who expect that pro-business policies will make for a favorable selling environment. This confidence should accelerate in areas like Santa Clarita, where properties will appeal to diverse buyer groups seeking competitive deals in a family-oriented community.

My advice for sellers is straightforward: prepare to move fast. Buyers are more likely to waive contingencies and adjust timeframes to secure properties, especially as we move into the new year. Remember, your “First Responder Realtor” is here to make sure that every negotiation is in your best interest, safeguarding your goals and maximizing your returns. If you’re considering selling, reach out so I can walk you through a detailed market analysis and help you craft a listing strategy that leverages this high-stakes environment.
