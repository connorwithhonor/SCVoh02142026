## 1. Case-Shiller Home Price Index Overview

The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index remains one of the most trusted indicators of housing trends in major U.S. markets. As we wrapped up 2024, the data revealed:

  - A 3.9% year-over-year (YOY) increase in national home prices.

  - 20-City Composite: +4.5% YOY.

  - 10-City Composite: +4.9% YOY.

These numbers indicate robust demand in many metro areas. However, as we approach the end of the year, seasonal adjustments—reflected in slight declines—signal a transition to a more moderated phase.

## 2. Santa Clarita Market Snapshot

Santa Clarita’s market reflects national trends while also displaying unique local characteristics. Here are the key metrics as of early March 2025:

  - **Weekly New Listings:** Approximately 100 to 115 new listings per week.

  - **Total Active Listings:** Over 568 active properties as of March 6, 2025.

  - **Interest Rates:** Slightly easing rates are encouraging more buyers to re-enter the market, which could drive prices higher if supply does not keep pace.

**Local Impact:** Sellers face increased competition due to rising inventory, while buyers benefit from a broader range of options and more room for negotiation.

## 3. 2024 Trends and Their Impact on 2025

### Recap of 2024

  - The housing market experienced a strong uptrend with a 3.9% YOY increase nationally.

  - Major city composites recorded increases of 4.5% and 4.9% respectively.

### Transitioning Into 2025

  - **Inventory Buildup:** With a steady addition of up to 115 new listings per week, supply is beginning to catch up with demand.

  - **Market Saturation:** Increased active listings (568+) mean sellers might experience longer days on market if prices are not competitive.

  - **Interest Rate Effects:** Easing rates improve affordability, which might prompt sellers to adjust pricing strategies.

Overall, while demand remains strong, the market appears to be entering a more balanced phase in early 2025.
