I was a cop for a long time and it came down to whether or not a person was telling the truth. Most times the truth is found out when data is provided about the market and how that "data" was interpreted and if it made sense.

Truth - usually in a market what has a high buyer drive and limited inventory, there is limited competition between seller, because they are not in high numbers. But when the new year comes, the market will have more inventory, as history shoes, an almost 40% update in inventory.

If the buyer demand stays high, or is revived due to some positive change (that'd be a reduction) in interest rate, then those homes will go out at a premium. But, what if there is not much change? Then those sellers are going to have competition and may have to go through a series of price reductions in order to adjust with the Santa Clarita market.

We know the market now - future is hard to determine. We know the markets in the past and that is a better gage than tomorrow.

**Santa Clarita Real Estate Update: November Insights &amp; Strategic Advice**

Welcome to your November 2nd update on Santa Clarita’s real estate market! Today marks the 307th day of 2024, and it's time to dig into the numbers, trends, and strategies you need to know to make the most of this shifting market. As "Connor with Honor," a First Responder Realtor with a history of service, I aim to provide you with transparent, no-nonsense insights to navigate Santa Clarita's dynamic real estate scene. This article provides a full breakdown of today’s data, as well as tried-and-true strategies to make your move—whether you're buying or selling.

### Market Snapshot: New Listings &amp; Price Adjustments

This past week, we’ve had **55 new listings** hitting the Santa Clarita Valley, with **64 price changes** across properties. What does this tell us? Sellers are adjusting to the realities of the market, understanding that competitive pricing is key to attracting serious buyers. For potential buyers, this means options are opening up, and many properties are likely positioned with flexible pricing, ready for negotiation.

#### Why Price Matters—Especially Now

If you're a seller, let's be blunt: you get one shot to make a first impression. Pricing your home right from the start is more crucial than ever. Santa Clarita buyers have access to ample data and are savvy about market value. Sellers, ensure your price reflects true market value and stands out among the competition. This isn't a market for dreamland prices; if you’re committed to selling, align with current trends, or be prepared to stay on the market longer.

For buyers, now is a golden opportunity. A price adjustment often indicates motivated sellers who are open to negotiation. Use this window to your advantage, but come prepared with an offer that respects the value of the property. Sellers respect serious buyers, and an informed, thoughtful offer can make all the difference.

### The Value of “Coming Soon” and “Back on Market” Properties

Not all opportunities are in the active listings. **Five “coming soon” properties** and **16 back-on-market listings** can be goldmines for savvy buyers. These properties represent hidden opportunities to get a great deal.

#### Buyers: Tap into Coming Soon and Back on Market Listings

“Coming soon” properties allow you to gauge what’s upcoming before the general public sees it. This gives you time to evaluate a property, understand its surroundings, and assess if it’s worth jumping on when it officially lists.

"Back on market" properties, on the other hand, may indicate an earlier deal that fell through, often due to financing issues or inspection results. This can be a hidden gem because these sellers might be more willing to negotiate the second time around. Don’t overlook these listings—they could provide the perfect opportunity to secure a home with favorable terms.

### Active Market Movement: Under Contract and Pending Properties

This week, **19 properties went under contract, and 42 went pending**—a strong indicator of buyer demand. While Santa Clarita remains a competitive market, a well-priced property with a compelling offer will not sit idle for long.

#### Buyers: Get Pre-Approved and Be Ready

This market is not for the indecisive. If you’re serious about buying, get pre-approved and have your financials ready. A pre-approved buyer stands out and is far more likely to secure a property amid high demand. And if you find a home that feels right, move swiftly. Time is of the essence, and hesitation can cost you.

#### Sellers: Price to Attract or Prepare to Adjust

The number of **56 closed sales** this week shows that sellers who price competitively can close deals. But there’s a cautionary tale in the **11 expired listings**—homes that did not sell due to overpricing or lack of readiness. Don’t let your property become a cautionary tale. Focus on realistic pricing and ensure your home is showing at its best.

### Canceled, Withdrawn, and On-Hold Listings: A Strategic Opportunity

This week, **10 listings were canceled, seven were withdrawn, and 13 were placed on hold**. Sellers, this is often a sign that the property needs repositioning in the market, whether that’s a price tweak, minor repairs, or simply waiting for better timing.

#### Buyers: Consider Canceled and Withdrawn Listings

These listings can be diamonds in the rough. Often, sellers are simply regrouping, possibly adjusting pricing or making repairs. For a buyer, these homes represent another opportunity to secure a favorable deal, often with sellers more open to negotiation. If you find a home that was pulled from the market, don’t hesitate to reach out. You may find the seller receptive to your interest, especially with the right offer.

#### Sellers: Know When to Adjust or Hold Off

If you're considering pulling your listing, ensure you have a solid strategy. Sometimes, a small price adjustment or minor repairs can bring it back to life. Rethink the timing and condition of your property if it’s not getting traction—there’s a solution to every challenge, but it requires flexibility and an openness to market realities.

### Smart Strategies for Success

Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, this market calls for intelligence and preparation. Here are some tips tailored for both:

#### Buyers: Crafting a Competitive Offer Beyond Price

It’s not always about the highest price. Here are some additional elements that can strengthen your offer:

#### Sellers: How to Make Your Home Stand Out
