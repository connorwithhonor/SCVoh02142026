### **Why Home Buyers Are Cancelling Escrow**

One of the main reasons buyers are cancelling escrow isn’t always related to the property. Many cancellations happen due to changes in the buyer’s financial situation, such as:

	- Job loss or changes in employment

	- Issues with financing or credit score changes

	- Large purchases (like cars or other significant expenses) made during escrow, which affect loan approval

If you're a seller, understanding these buyer-side challenges can help you better prepare and manage your listings, minimizing the risk of a cancelled escrow. If you're a buyer, staying financially stable during the escrow period is essential to ensure a smooth transaction.
