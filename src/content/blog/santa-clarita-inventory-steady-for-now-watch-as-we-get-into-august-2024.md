I’m Connor MacIvor, your trusted real estate expert, and today is July 30th, 2024. Welcome to your daily real estate update! If you’re looking for the most current and comprehensive real estate information, you can find all our shows at [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](http://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com). It’s just after 5 AM, and I’m excited to dive into today’s market highlights.

### **Market Overview**

We currently have 468 active real estate listings across all of Santa Clarita Valley, covering single-family residences, townhomes, and condos. Here’s the breakdown of our market activity over the past seven days:

	- **Coming Soon**: 6 properties

	- **New Listings**: 83 properties

	- **Price Changes**: 82 properties

	- **Back On Market**: 23 properties

	- **Active Under Contract**: 33 properties

	- **Pending**: 53 properties

	- **Closed**: 58 properties

	- **Expired**: 5 properties

	- **Canceled**: 12 properties

	- **Hold**: 8 properties

	- **Withdrawn**: 3 properties

### **Current Market Trends**

The number of price changes has been increasing steadily over the past 8-9 weeks and now remains consistent at around 82. This trend, along with the steady influx of new listings, indicates a balanced yet active market. Despite the increased inventory, properties are still moving quickly, with typical market time frames ranging from 7 to 14 days in Santa Clarita Valley.

Even with the additional inventory, we are not seeing an overbuild that would shift the market from a seller's to a buyer's market. Properties are entering escrow almost as quickly as they are listed.

### **Insights for Buyers**

For buyers, understanding the price per square foot is crucial. For example, a property at [15518 Nasturtium DR](http://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com) is listed at $799,999 with a price per square foot of $607.90. New listings such as [20419 Samual DR](http://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com) at $1,050,000 and [26312 Whispering Leaves DR](http://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com) at $759,000 offer fresh opportunities. Knowing the community details, such as subdivisions like California Bluffs and Hawks Pointe, can help you make informed decisions. Visit [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](http://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com) to see the listings, photos, virtual tours, and all the statistics.

### **Advice for Sellers**

Sellers should take note of competitive pricing strategies. Properties like [28254 Bakerton AVE](http://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com) listed at $1,040,000 and [30347 June Rose CT](http://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com) at $1,050,000 are prime examples. It's also essential to understand market activities such as properties going back on the market. Check out [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](http://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com) for detailed information on these listings.

### **Handling Inspections and Price Negotiations**

Sellers should be prepared for buyers requesting repairs or credits post-inspection. While it’s a buyer’s right to request adjustments, sellers have the right to deny unreasonable demands. For instance, a request for a $3,000 price reduction due to minor electrical issues that cost significantly less to fix is not justified.

### **Looking Ahead**

As we approach September, we anticipate a possible relaxation of interest rates, which could spur faster movements in the real estate market. If you’re a buyer, be prepared for increased competition. Ensuring you have the necessary financial tools and support will be crucial in navigating this competitive landscape.

### **Conclusion**

I’ll continue to monitor the inventory and market trends closely and keep you updated. As we move into August, we’ll have a clearer picture of the market’s direction. Thank you for joining today’s update. I’m Connor with Honor, and I’m here whenever you’re ready to make your next move in the Santa Clarita real estate market.

Stay tuned for our Hump Day edition tomorrow. Be well, Santa Clarita Valley!

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
