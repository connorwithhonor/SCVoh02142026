Big changes which are starting to get into full swing within the real estate realm. I'm a Realtor serving Los Angeles and the areas surrounding it. If you are going to keep a large following, you need to realize who's important and who is not.

You, all of you, are important. Me - I get to come in a solid second place, always and forever. That makes me happy, but I still love myself and forgive myself, which had me conquer my adult and childhood obesity, where I was an astounding 55% body fat - Over 1/2 of my 365 pound fat self was, FAT!

**Good Day, Santa Clarita!**

It's Connor with Honor, and I hope everyone is doing fantastic! This is your weekend update for Sunday, September 1st. The numbers for August 2024 are not yet finalized, but I want to discuss the most significant recent changes in the real estate market—specifically, some contractual changes due to a settled lawsuit involving the National Association of Realtors.

**New Buyer Requirements:**

If you're in the market to buy a home, you'll now be required to sign a Buyer-Broker Agreement before viewing any property. This contract will outline several important details:

![](https://idx-acnt-ihouseprd.b-cdn.net/AR1197716/file_manager/to%20see%20a%20home%20you%20must%20sign%20a%20contract%20with%20a%20real%20estate%20agent.jpg?width=400&amp;height=399&amp;aspect_ratio=400%3A399)There is a lot to consider, so be sure to read the contract carefully. Remember, I'm not an attorney, so I can't provide legal advice about contract details.

**Navigating Real Estate Relationships:**

Let's imagine a scenario: a potential buyer calls an agent and asks to see a specific property. The agent, who does not currently represent the buyer, asks if they have a real estate agent. If the buyer says no, the agent might offer to represent them, explaining how great they are at their job. The buyer might respond positively, saying they’ve read good things online and are interested in working with the agent.

However, if the buyer only wants to see one property and is unwilling to sign the Buyer-Broker Agreement or provide their contact information, it can create friction. The agent might try to negotiate, explaining that they need the contract to show the property and that their fees must be agreed upon beforehand.

This back-and-forth can lead to a difficult conversation, especially if the buyer is adamant about not wanting to sign the agreement or share their information. In this scenario, the agent must decide if it's worth pursuing the relationship when it’s already adversarial from the start.

**Why You Might Want Your Own Representation:**

There are also cases where buyers prefer to deal directly with the listing agent, believing it might get them a better deal. They might think the listing agent knows the seller's bottom line and can negotiate more effectively. However, keep in mind that the listing agent will also know your bottom line, which could put you at a disadvantage.

In most cases, it’s beneficial to have your own agent who represents your interests exclusively. Think of it like hiring an attorney: you wouldn’t hire the same lawyer representing the opposing party in a lawsuit.

**Current Market Trends:**

Now, let’s look at where the market stands today. We've reached about 500 units for sale in the Santa Clarita Valley. The market remains a strong seller's market, with properties typically staying on the market for only 10 to 15 days, depending on the city. In Los Angeles or areas closer to the beach, like Venice, the timeframe is even shorter, often with multiple offers quickly.

When choosing an agent, consider their ability to represent your interests, regardless of the location. Whether you’re dealing with a local agent or someone less familiar with the area, what matters most is their dedication to doing the research, understanding the market dynamics, and serving you from beginning to end.

Remember, trust is the most crucial factor when hiring an agent.

**Final Thoughts:**

Thank you all for watching today’s update! I know I’ve covered a lot, but these are important changes to consider. I’ll keep you updated as the market evolves. Until then, be well!

I'm Connor with Honor—signing off for now.
