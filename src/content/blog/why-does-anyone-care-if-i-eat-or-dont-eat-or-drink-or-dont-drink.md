**A Journey from Fat to Fit: A First Responder Realtor's Transformation in Santa Clarita, CA**

This is something I didn't expect to encounter on my journey from **fat to fit**. For those who know me, I'm a **first responder realtor in Santa Clarita, CA**, who has torched off 135 pounds of body fat over eight months. I used fasting to get my hormones in line, and everything worked out. But some of the unexpected challenges I faced might resonate with you, and perhaps you can translate them into your own life.

### The Social Dynamics of Eating and Drinking

One thing I realized is how integral eating and drinking are to our social interactions with friends and family. Part of the enjoyment is the food, the drinks, and spending time together over meals and alcohol. Many people prioritize these activities, and that's great—it serves them well.

However, to achieve what I did—and what you can do—it takes willpower, discipline, and a reformatting of how you think about things. For me, food is no longer something I use to enhance social gatherings. I'm not meeting people to enjoy food; I'm meeting people to enjoy **people**. I don't view food as a necessary component of socializing because I can connect with others on a walking path, in a park, at the gym, or along the beach. There are countless places to meet that don't revolve around food.

### Navigating Social Events While Staying True to Myself

I'm blessed to still have friends who appreciate me—maybe not a large number, but meaningful relationships nonetheless. Recently, I was invited to a large dinner party. It was fantastic; there was an abundance of amazing food. However, the food didn't align with what I normally eat. I've learned to respect myself enough to not partake in something that doesn't serve my goals.

It's similar to alcohol. When someone quits drinking, people often assume there's a problem. They might wonder why someone doesn't drink anymore and speculate about potential issues. But sometimes, people choose not to drink because they don't like how it makes them feel or the impact it has on their health.

At the dinner party, a couple returned to the table with plates piled high and noticed I wasn't eating. They asked, "Aren't you going to eat?" I replied, "I ate earlier." They responded, "Oh, but not like this!" They couldn't fathom why I would deprive myself of such delicious food.

### My Approach to Eating and Health

In reality, I didn't have all that fancy, high-carbohydrate, sugar-laden, fat-combined food earlier. I had about a pound of ground turkey mixed with an entire onion, a little apple cider vinegar, salt, pepper, and maybe some turmeric. I also had eight to ten hard-boiled eggs. That's a typical meal for me—once a day, and then I hang it up.

If I decide to indulge or have a cheat meal, it's a very well-planned event. I've learned this approach because, in the past, I was cheating all the time. I'd find myself in drive-thrus, ordering multiple tacos, french fries, milkshakes—all sorts of unhealthy options. I've moved away from that lifestyle.

When the couple questioned my choices, I thought to myself, "I'm not eating because I like the way I look and feel now, and I didn't like how I looked and felt before." It's not hard for me because I no longer have the health and metabolic issues I once had. I'm not carrying the excess weight I used to.

### From a 65-Inch Waist to a 34-Inch Waist

At 270 pounds, fluctuating between 260 and 270, I'm nowhere near where I was with a 65-inch waist at 365 pounds. I didn't know what to say to them, but it was clear they thought I was committing the ultimate sin by not eating when I could. As I observed them, I couldn't help but think, "How could you deprive yourself of being in better shape? How could you deprive yourself of feeling better?"

They asked why I would deprive myself, but in my mind, I was considering how they were depriving themselves of health and vitality. It's not about the food I'm missing; it's about the life I'm gaining.

### The Challenge of Changing Perceptions

It's interesting how society reacts when you don't conform to the norm of indulging in food and drink, especially during social gatherings. People may project their insecurities onto you, questioning your choices because it challenges their own habits.

I've come to understand that it's not just about willpower; it's about recognizing and overcoming the sabotage we have ingrained in us. It's about breaking free from the addiction to foods filled with sugar and unhealthy fats—combinations not found in nature.

### Embracing Natural Foods

People often ask what they should eat. Dr. Andrew Huberman puts it simply: "Eat meat, eat fish, eat eggs, eat vegetables, and eat fruit." Stick to natural foods and avoid processed items. For those looking to **torch off body fat**, overeating natural foods is less likely compared to processed ones laden with sugars and fats.

When it comes to foods like pizza, it's easy to overindulge and still feel hungry later. Sugary, carbohydrate-rich foods like rice, pasta, pastries, and cakes aren't the best for you, and you can consume large amounts without real satiety.

### The Power of Fasting

If you're considering making a change, start right now by perhaps skipping the next meal and picking it up later. Maybe delay breakfast—after all, "breakfast" literally means breaking your fast. Move that meal to lunchtime and see how you feel. You'll find that hunger comes in waves. It peaks but then subsides if you ride it out.

When I began this journey, I started slowly. I felt better, saw the numbers on the scale decrease, and had more energy. I delved into researching fasting, which, by the way, is free—it doesn't cost you anything.

### Understanding Hunger and Metabolism

Hunger often strikes at times you're accustomed to eating. If you usually eat at 7 am, noon, and 5 pm, your body will signal hunger at those times. But after about an hour or two of not eating, the hunger diminishes. It's not continuous or unbearable.

I tried caloric restriction in the past, which often slows down the metabolism. Fasting, on the other hand, can increase metabolic rate. It's not about depriving yourself but about allowing your body to reset and heal.

### Making the Choice to Change

I didn't have to hit rock bottom to make this change; it simply didn't align with the lifestyle I wanted. You might be addicted to processed foods, but that is also a choice. I believe you can overcome it—it will take time and determination.

Start by not eating breakfast and see how that feels. If your last meal was at 5 pm, by delaying breakfast, you've given your body a substantial fasting period. You might find that you have more energy and feel better overall.

### It's More Than Just Food

I genuinely believe that those who continue consuming processed and sugary foods without making dietary changes may find it challenging to achieve their health goals. Exercise is beneficial, but as they say, "abs are made in the kitchen." The foundation of health starts with what you eat.

### Reclaiming Your Health and Life

I believe you can recapture your health, and it begins with gentle changes in your eating habits. Educate yourself, understand that many of us are or were addicted to processed foods. I can still hear the calling of a beautiful pizza or other indulgent foods, but I know where I am now is where I'd rather be.

This experience is one I thought I'd never share. People may wonder why I would "deprive" myself of certain foods, not knowing my history or how much better I feel now. It's not about deprivation; it's about making choices that align with the life I want.

### Final Thoughts

If you're considering a change, remember that it's possible. Start small, be patient with yourself, and know that each step you take is a move toward a healthier, happier you. As a **first responder realtor in Santa Clarita, CA**, I've made this journey from fat to fit, and I believe you can too.
