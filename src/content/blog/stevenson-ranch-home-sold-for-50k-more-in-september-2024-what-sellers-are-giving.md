Connor with Honor here, and today is **day 272 of 2024**, that's right, **Saturday, September 28th**, and we've got your weekly Santa Clarita Real Estate Market update. If you’ve been wondering what’s happening with the market, buckle up, because these numbers tell a powerful story!"

#### Market Overview

"Let’s dive right into the numbers for this past week in the Santa Clarita Valley:

	- **Coming Soon**: 12 properties

	- **New Listings**: 57 homes just hit the market

	- **Price Changes**: 71 listings saw price adjustments – and with the rates fluctuating, it’s no surprise.

	- **Back On Market**: 18 homes that fell out of escrow are now back on the market, creating new opportunities for buyers.

	- **Active Under Contract**: 31 homes are currently in escrow, meaning the deals are underway.

	- **Pending**: 47 homes are in the final stages before closing.

	- **Closed**: 63 homes have successfully closed this week – congrats to those new homeowners!

	- **Expired**: 5 listings didn’t sell within their contract time and have expired.

	- **Canceled**: 14 homes were pulled off the market for various reasons.

	- **Hold**: 11 homes are on hold, likely due to repairs or seller timing.

	- **Withdrawn**: 4 homes have been withdrawn from the market altogether.

Right now, we’re looking at **528 active residential real estate listings** for sale in the Santa Clarita Valley. That's your current inventory as of today."

#### Analysis &amp; Trends

"Now, what does this mean for buyers and sellers in Santa Clarita? Well, the **71 price changes** suggest that some sellers are adjusting their expectations, likely due to the current interest rate environment. With **57 new listings**, we still see inventory entering the market, but as **31 homes went under contract** and **47 went pending**, it’s clear that there’s still plenty of buyer activity despite any hesitancy.

The **63 closed homes** this week show that deals are still getting done, but keep an eye on the **14 cancellations** and **5 expireds** — this tells us that not every listing is finding its buyer right away. Proper pricing is essential right now."

#### Relating Current Headlines to Santa Clarita

"Let’s talk about what’s in the news. Headlines across real estate are buzzing about cooling national markets, but how does that relate to Santa Clarita?

The national cooling doesn’t hit us as hard here in Santa Clarita. Why? It’s the inventory! With **528 active listings**, we’re still seeing demand. Buyers, especially here, are trying to lock in homes before rates fluctuate further. Sellers, if you're thinking about listing, make sure your home is competitively priced to stand out among these price changes and new listings."

#### Conclusion

"So, what does this mean for you? Buyers, now is the time to get into those homes that are back on the market or had price changes. Sellers, if you’re serious, proper pricing and presentation will make all the difference. That’s your Santa Clarita Market Watch update for **Saturday, September 28th, 2024**.
