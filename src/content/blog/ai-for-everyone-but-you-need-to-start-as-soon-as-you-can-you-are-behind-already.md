## My Mission With AI and Why It Matters

My mission at AI with Honor is to educate people about artificial intelligence by learning and understanding it myself, and then conveying it in a way that makes sense. By sharing what I learn, I stay mindful of the changes happening in the AI landscape—especially how much money is being poured into it and how quickly it is being implemented. There seems to be no real braking mechanism out there. People talk about ethics and guardrails, but ultimately, it all depends on the data that trains these models. Since all data carries its own biases, any AI model might learn certain prejudices or tendencies from that data.

    Take the AI Integration Questionnaire

In the future, synthetic data might become more common. In fact, that is already happening. For instance, if you use data from a platform like Facebook to train a model, the AI will tend to reflect whatever biases or viewpoints it encounters there. Then if the model is asked to address other sectors in the world, it might produce skewed or partial perspectives. That is one reason there are big conversations about ethical controls and safety measures in artificial intelligence.

I also think about narrow AI—highly specialized systems designed for very specific tasks, such as playing chess, discovering new chemical compounds, or doing medical research. The wider goal is what many refer to as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which would handle nearly everything. Eventually, beyond AGI, people discuss the idea of super intelligence, where an AI might exceed human capabilities in virtually every domain. As I listen to various discussions and podcasts about AI, it is clear that we are still trying to wrap our minds around where all of this is headed.

Before 2023, AI was relatively quiet for most people. Then, with the release of tools like ChatGPT (first the GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 models, and now even more advanced versions), everything changed seemingly overnight. The excitement spread quickly. Other solutions like Elon Musk's Grok, Google's Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and third-party tools such as Perplexity AI began appearing. Some companies also specialize in taking a language model from one part of the world and stripping it of certain biases—like removing government censorship from a Chinese-developed model—so it can be more widely used elsewhere. There are debates about how these interventions should happen and how different countries or companies enforce their own version of acceptable answers.

In the United States, we hope to have a fairly “unlocked” AI environment, but there are still restrictions. For example, instructions on how to build a bomb or do something nefarious are typically withheld. There is a line between knowledge that should be made broadly available and dangerous information that can lead to harm. Every AI system, no matter how open, has some kind of content filter for these reasons.

## Exploring Different AI Models and Their Applications

Among the chatbots I use are ChatGPT, Grok, and various others. They all come with different pros and cons. Grok 3, for example, might work exceptionally well in certain tasks, such as real estate content creation, but it may not format information the same way I am used to seeing in ChatGPT. This matters if I want HTML formatting for blog posts, or if I rely on a specific style for bullet points and headings. ChatGPT has grown used to how I ask for certain outputs, and so it provides those more readily. On the flip side, new models often have features that older ones lack.

One big lesson is that you do not always have to choose one single AI. Trying different platforms can help you figure out which system handles a particular task more effectively. Some are best at creative writing, while others excel at structured problem-solving. In real estate, for example, I might use one system to process daily market data, while another is perfect for rewriting blog content or creating Q&amp;A surveys.

I have done a lot of experimentation with my own real estate blog at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com. Every day, I gather data from the Multiple Listing Service (MLS)—information like how many new listings appear, how many price changes occur, or whether we are trending up or down in terms of inventory. I feed that data into an AI that can parse it and return neatly organized statistics. Then I use another AI to craft a blog post that includes SEO-friendly links back to relevant pages on my website. If my platform allows it, I give the AI my site map so it can handle internal linking more efficiently than I could do by hand.

## Integrating AI in Real Estate

Real estate agents often have a lot on their plate: lead generation, client follow-ups, property showings, negotiations, and administrative tasks. AI becomes a valuable tool in this domain because it can automate parts of the workflow:

	- 
	**Lead Qualification**: An AI chatbot can screen leads, collect initial details, and direct high-probability buyers or sellers to you for follow-up. It can also learn from interactions, improving its qualification process over time.

	

	- 
	**Blog and Content Creation**: AI can produce daily or weekly market updates, property descriptions, and even answer frequently asked questions. By feeding it data from the MLS and letting it reference your site map, you get SEO-optimized blog posts without having to manually link to each relevant page.

	

	- 
	**Contract Analysis**: Although AI is not a substitute for a qualified attorney, you can use it as a preliminary check for real estate contracts. It might catch glaring issues or missing clauses, but you should always do a final review.

	

	- 
	**Market Predictions**: AI can analyze historical data alongside present market conditions to forecast trends. While it is never 100% certain, these predictions can inform what kinds of marketing campaigns you run, how you advise clients on pricing, and how you assess incoming leads.

	

In this way, AI lets real estate professionals focus more on relationship-building and less on repetitive tasks. For instance, I can rely on a chatbot to handle website queries at 2:00 a.m., or to compile daily stats from the MLS. When I wake up, I am simply reviewing the output rather than doing manual data entry.

## The Importance of Caution and Verification

One challenge is ensuring the information AI provides is accurate. Just because a system says something confidently does not mean it is true. I always double-check what the AI has written, especially when producing final content for my clients or my own blog. This can be as simple as fact-checking the system’s references or verifying that the links it provides actually point to the correct pages.

I often remind fellow agents that if you are creating a piece of content—like a blog post about a grant program for first-time buyers—AI can be very persuasive. However, it might reference non-existent programs, old data, or laws that have changed. Always do a reality check before publishing.

For similar reasons, I also mention that while these tools can handle large volumes of data in seconds, the user has to exercise common sense about the results. For example, you can’t expect an AI to understand the local nuances of your housing market unless you feed it the correct data. If you are uploading your own site map or property listings, that’s one step closer to building a localized, specialized AI conversation.

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

There is a larger ethical question around AI that we are still grappling with. Models can learn harmful biases if the data they train on is biased. Different countries and governments have their own guidelines. In some places, the government censors certain topics or shapes the conversation so that the AI cannot talk freely about certain issues. Meanwhile, other places aim to make the system as open as possible, though they might still restrict truly dangerous information like how to create a biological weapon.

In the realm of real estate, we are subject to our own rules around fair housing and non-discrimination. If an AI system were to recommend properties or reject leads based on biased data, that would be a serious problem. So, we have to be careful that the AI we use is not inadvertently skewing results. That might mean giving it safe parameters or verifying that the data it references does not contain discriminatory patterns.

## AI in Other Disciplines and the Future of Work

Outside of real estate, similar logic applies to any field: healthcare, finance, marketing, education, and more. We see specialized AI that can do tasks like diagnosing diseases from medical images, analyzing DNA sequences, or identifying financial fraud. These are considered narrower AI applications but can be extremely powerful in their domains.

Then, there is the bigger conversation about AI automating entire job categories. People worry about jobs that might become obsolete once AI systems can perform the same tasks more cheaply and quickly. At the same time, AI creates new opportunities and might transform roles rather than outright eliminating them. I encourage anyone feeling anxious about this to look at how they can integrate AI into their workflow proactively. That way, you remain valuable and adapt alongside the technology.

A question that often comes up: “What about artificial general intelligence (AGI) and super intelligence?” The idea is that once we cross a certain threshold, the system becomes capable of everything a human can do, but faster and potentially better. Some see this as dangerous, especially if there are no strong guardrails. Others see it as an incredible evolutionary leap forward for humanity.

Ultimately, decisions about how we integrate AI into society happen on multiple levels: individual, business, government, and global. Different players will have different incentives. Some want to make a profit as quickly as possible; others want to ensure ethical standards. It is a balancing act that is still evolving.

## Practical Uses of AI in My Daily Business

To give a clear example, here is how I personally integrate AI into my daily routine as a real estate professional:

	- 
	**Daily MLS Data Extraction**: Every morning, I gather property listings, changes, and trends. I feed that data into an AI model that organizes and highlights the most significant numbers.

	

	- 
	**Blog Content**: Using the output of that AI, I craft a short blog post. I typically rely on ChatGPT or a similar model to ensure the text is coherent and properly linked back to relevant pages on my website. This might include linking the phrase “Valencia houses for sale” to the Valencia property search page, improving SEO without me having to manually input each hyperlink.

	

	- 
	**Video and Captions**: When I record a video update—say, a five-minute briefing on the real estate market—I use AI-based editing tools. CapCut is one example; it can add captions automatically. I still review them, especially for localized words like “Santa Clarita,” since these can be mistranslated or misheard.

	

	- 
	**Chatbots and Lead Capture**: My site might receive queries at odd hours. A chatbot fields those queries, collects the user’s basic information, and provides immediate responses. When I start my workday, I see a list of leads with relevant details, saving me the effort of chasing down every individual question manually.

	

	- 
	**Customer Surveys**: If I want feedback from site visitors—like why they might hesitate to buy a home in the current market—I can ask AI tools to build me a simple HTML or JavaScript survey form. I embed it in the blog, and visitors can fill it out quickly. The data from those surveys can then be processed to give me insights on what’s holding people back.

	

## Staying Updated and Continual Learning

I constantly look for new AI tools. Microsoft might announce a quantum computing breakthrough that could slash the training time for AI models. Another company might refine their natural language model so that it does a better job interpreting complicated legal contracts. The speed of advancement is staggering, so it helps to follow the news closely.

One personal habit is reading up on any major AI announcements or attending webinars. If I find a relevant update, I try to see how it fits into my everyday processes. Sometimes, these updates are minor and do not directly impact what I do. Other times, they open up a possibility I had not considered, such as using an image recognition AI to categorize property photos automatically.

For real estate professionals who feel overwhelmed, I usually suggest picking one small project—like installing a chatbot or generating a single AI-driven blog post—and seeing how it goes. You do not have to overhaul your entire business overnight. AI is a tool that can be integrated in increments, allowing you time to adjust, review, and refine your approach.

## Ethics, Guardrails, and the Race for AI

There is no doubt that massive amounts of money go into AI development. From billion-dollar investments by tech giants to venture capital funds backing start-ups, everyone seems to be racing toward new breakthroughs. Ethical questions arise because the faster we move, the more chances we have to overlook important safeguards. Some argue that advanced AI might run away from us if we are not careful, while others believe humans are resilient enough to handle whatever challenges AI brings.

It is easy to become cynical and say that everything is being driven by profit. While that may be largely true, there are also smart people focusing on building safe and beneficial AI. The question is whether we can strike a balance, especially as big players compete in the arms race of AI innovation.

Meanwhile, from a business perspective, especially in real estate, not everyone cares about the existential questions. Many agents just want a better way to handle leads, data, or marketing. That is perfectly understandable. However, I do believe we should keep these bigger picture issues in mind, so we do not wake up one day and find that certain fundamental ethical lines have been crossed.

## AI in Education and Future Generations

Another application I touched on is AI in the classroom. Systems can analyze facial expressions, posture, and engagement levels to tell the teacher which students look confused or unengaged. This can theoretically help tailor education to each student’s needs. But it also opens questions about privacy, data storage, and who has access to that information.

Just as in real estate, schools that use AI have to decide how much information is shared, how it is stored, and whether the students or their guardians have any say in what happens with the data. Those are policy questions that are still being hashed out.

On a broader scale, future generations might grow up with AI integrated into almost every aspect of their daily lives. Scheduling, banking, even diagnosing minor medical issues might become as simple as asking an advanced AI system. Jobs will shift as a result, and so will the types of skills that people need. Whether that is good or bad depends on how we manage the transition.

## Conclusion: Where I Stand and How I Can Help

At this point, I focus on two main areas: running my real estate business efficiently by leveraging AI tools, and also assisting others—particularly real estate agents—in adopting AI in their own operations. Not every agent has the time or desire to research AI, so I end up doing consultations, showing them how chatbots, content generators, and data analytics can save them time.

This whole idea of an AI consultancy service has grown naturally out of my experimentation. As I discovered how to blog daily updates, create surveys, or generate code snippets for my site, colleagues started asking how I did it. That led to me helping them set up their own systems. Over time, I developed a process where I can come in, look at a business, figure out how they handle data, what their biggest pain points are, and propose an AI-based workflow that might help.

I constantly tweak this approach, because AI is never static. New models and features pop up weekly. If you are interested in any of this—particularly the integration of AI in real estate—I always suggest starting small. Let me help you identify an immediate need, such as lead capture. We figure out the best AI tool, install it, train it, and see how it goes. From there, we expand to other tasks, like content marketing, contract analysis, or more advanced market predictions.

Going forward, I am also curious about quantum computing breakthroughs, advanced neural networks, and other cutting-edge technologies that might be around the corner. We might be talking about things like room-temperature superconductors, or million-qubit chips that can transform AI into a level of computing power we currently cannot even imagine. That future is likely coming sooner than we think.

At the end of the day, humans remain flexible and creative. While the pace of technological change can be intimidating, it is also exciting. My goal is to stay on top of these changes, use AI responsibly, and help others do the same.

Thank you for reading, and I hope this gives you a clearer picture of how I view AI, how I integrate it into my real estate business, and how I believe it can benefit many other industries as well. If you want to explore AI for your own operations or just discuss these topics in more depth, feel free to reach out. I look forward to continuing the journey of AI with honor.
