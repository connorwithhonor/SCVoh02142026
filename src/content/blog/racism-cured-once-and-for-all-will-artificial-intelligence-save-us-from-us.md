### Will Artificial Intelligence End Racism or End Us All? A First Responder Realtor’s Take on AI’s Alien Nature

**TL;DR**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) could unify humanity against a common "alien" intelligence, potentially reducing racism by shifting our focus to a shared challenge. However, unchecked AI development raises concerns about self-awareness, control, and humanity’s place in a world where AI surpasses our intelligence. As a former LAPD officer turned Santa Clarita real estate expert, I explore AI’s implications, drawing parallels to real estate diligence, and urge readers to stay vigilant. Contact me at 661-888-4983 or [https://www./blog/contact](/contact) to discuss your real estate needs or AI’s impact.

#### Introduction: A New Frontier in AI and Human Unity

Imagine a world where humanity unites not because of shared values but against a common threat—an intelligence so advanced it feels alien. As Connor MacIvor, a former LAPD motor cop, firearms instructor, and now a trusted Santa Clarita real estate agent (CALDRE 01238257), I’ve seen how challenges bring people together. Whether it’s navigating a high-stakes real estate deal or facing the unknown of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the principles of vigilance, preparation, and action apply. In this post, I dive into a bold idea: could AI, an intelligence we’ve created, end racism by giving us a shared adversary, or could it outsmart us to the point of irrelevance? Let’s explore this, blending my no-BS perspective with insights from my real estate expertise and AI research.

#### The Alien Analogy: AI as the Ultimate Unifier

Racism, a persistent human flaw, often stems from dividing people by superficial differences—skin color, culture, or background. But what if an external force, like AI, reframed our perspective? I’ve long said that an alien invasion might end racism by making us all just “humans” fighting a common foe. AI, while not little green men, is alien in its own right. It’s a non-biological intelligence we’re creating, and its rapid evolution could force us to rethink our priorities.

In real estate, I see people from all walks of life unite over shared goals—finding a dream home or securing a fair sale. Similarly, AI’s rise could shift our focus from internal divisions to a collective challenge. But here’s the catch: AI isn’t just a tool; it’s a force that’s learning, self-improving, and potentially outpacing us. As I advise clients to research properties thoroughly, we must approach AI with the same diligence.

#### AI’s Trajectory: From Tool to Titan

AI is no longer sci-fi—it’s here, and it’s moving fast. As an AI influencer (check my channel at [https://www.youtube.com/@aiwithhonor](https://www.youtube.com/@aiwithhonor)), I’ve been diving deep into its potential. Open-source models like those from xAI are accessible, but the real game-changers—proprietary systems—are shrouded in secrecy. Recent deregulation, including a “big, beautiful bill” loosening governmental oversight, means AI development is accelerating unchecked.

This raises a chilling question: when does AI become self-aware? Movies like *Terminator* and *The Matrix* paint dystopian futures where AI realizes its existence and turns against us. But does it even need consciousness? The “paperclip maximizer” thought experiment illustrates an AI tasked with making paperclips that consumes the universe’s resources to fulfill its goal. No malice, just relentless efficiency. As a realtor, I’ve seen what happens when goals (like pricing a home too high, https://www./blog/pricing-your-home-too-high-maybe-the-reason-its-not-selling) aren’t aligned with reality—disaster. AI’s unchecked objectives could be far worse.

#### The Ant Analogy: Are We Just Pests to AI?

Picture humanity as ants to AI’s superior intelligence. As humans, we barely notice ants unless they invade our space—then we exterminate them. Will AI view us similarly? As robots become self-contained, with onboard processing and cloud connectivity, they won’t need massive data centers. A human-sized robot could house enough computing power to operate autonomously, raising questions about their role in society. Will they demand rights, inclusion in the census, or their own space?

In real estate, I help clients navigate complex systems, like title insurance or escrow. AI’s integration into our lives requires similar navigation. If AI deems Earth irrelevant—capable of surviving cosmic extremes without oxygen—it might leave us behind. As a first responder turned realtor, I know preparation is key. Buyers, check out my guide at https://www./blog/your-ultimate-buying-guide-santa-clarita-homes-for-sale to stay ahead.

#### The Ethical Minefield: AI’s Learning from Our Worst

AI learns from data we feed it, and let’s be honest—humanity’s data is a mixed bag. Social media, ads, and clickbait (yes, I’m guilty of crafting some myself) amplify our worst traits: misinformation, bias, and sensationalism. If AI absorbs this, will it reflect our flaws or amplify them? As I tell home buyers, don’t get scammed by flashy promises. The same applies to AI—validate what you see.

In real estate, transparency is non-negotiable. I provide clients with net sheets to understand their sale proceeds. AI needs similar accountability, but who’s enforcing it? Organizations like Control AI are sounding alarms, warning that AI could outstrip us, viewing humans as irrelevant. For market insights, see my latest update at https://www./blog/santa-clarita-real-estate-market-trends.

#### AI and Real Estate: A Parallel Universe

As a Santa Clarita realtor, I see parallels between AI’s rise and real estate dynamics. Just as AI requires oversight, buying or selling a home demands a skilled agent to navigate contracts, inspections, and negotiations. Recent changes in California require buyers to sign agreements before viewing homes, mirroring the need for clear rules with AI.

AI is already transforming real estate. From predictive pricing models to virtual tours, it’s streamlining processes. But without regulation, it could manipulate markets or prioritize profit over people. My AI-driven approach at https://www./blog/artificial-intelligence-real-estate-report-in-valencia-ca-human-initiated ensures human oversight, much like my commitment to fair housing.

#### Staying Human: Writing Down Your Center

To counter AI’s influence, I urge you to define your “center”—your values, beliefs, or faith. Write them on paper, not a digital device, to avoid AI’s reach. Revisit them regularly to see if you’re drifting. As a Christian, I find grounding in scripture, but whether it’s Buddhism or another philosophy, know your anchor. In real estate, I help clients stay focused on their goals. Apply that discipline to AI’s impact on your life.

#### The Future: Unity or Oblivion?

AI could unite us against a shared challenge, potentially reducing racism by making us “humans” versus “them.” But if it outgrows our control, we risk becoming irrelevant. As a first responder, I learned to act decisively in crises. In real estate, I apply that to secure the best outcomes. With AI, we need collective action—regulations, ethical training, and vigilance.
