How much time do you have left? There have been a lot of posts popping up on my social media that talk about if you are 50 and a man, you will have 28 more years left, then it breaks it down further. That's a lot and that brings me to today's update with regard to my fitness and health journey.

As you know I'm a Realtor, a Cop turned Realtor. That was a while back - but I have overlapping services with each the lapd and being a realtor. I type as I talk, sorry about that. But here we go with many thumbs thrown to the grammatical favored ;) -&nbsp;

LAPD was over 20 years, with some reserve service as a Level III reserve and as a full time lapd cop. I worked motors, and other assignments. I taught a lot of shooting subjects and was assigned at the lapd police academy, back in the 2000's in the firearms unit. I have a funny story about that. IN fact, I have about a million funny stories about working each and every assignment I had on the LAPD.

There was stress - but if you were one who could balance it, you were golden. IN fact, you knew the difference from viewing this life as a game versus a real simulation. The gamers won bigly. They were those who could go to play to win each and every day, not balancing life and death - LIFE should always win. A win was when public life was protected to their ultimate level, and where the bad guys went to jail in the easiest way possible to be able to be tried by a group of their peers.&nbsp;

I believe in that, to a fault. Life is said by some to be unfair. I don't agree - I think Life is absolutely as fair as It's going to be. With that little statement, my world bends on it's axis and contorts into what I need it to be at the time I need it.

Fault - neglecting family, children, and friends and other family. Admittance, attempt, then stop when desire. If that wound cannot be healed to the best of your ability, or just the consideration of it being handled to the best ability of the person doing the wet work, then it's done.&nbsp;

I take full responsibility for the lives i torched as a result of my neglect, conscious and unconscious. I am responsible for my present place, past and future.&nbsp;

Everything depends on the way I think about the incoming signals. So, if you are going to have a circle of friends or family you want to spend time with, make sure they are on the same page with you. And if they aren't on the same page, continue with them as long as they don't influence you in any way to go against the rules you set for yourself.

Prison - it sucks. I sent people there, I could go there, I accept everything, but I would imaging it sucks. I see it and I feel it and while it's sucks, I would not be able to let it break me. I have broken twice in my life and once was too much. IT's only out of the biggest traumas that the biggest changes take place.&nbsp;

Or they break you.&nbsp;

Cops break. I know a few that broke till they killed themselves in a weak act of desperation, for which there is no excuse for.

Today, I wanted to give you some of my experiences within the fasting to fitness realm. But, I know that there is not a lot of time. I want to live several hundred of years. With some of the creations as a result of AI, that maybe possible, but cost prohibitive.&nbsp;![](https://idx-acnt-ihouseprd.b-cdn.net/AR1197716/file_manager/lapd.jpg?width=450&amp;height=284&amp;aspect_ratio=450%3A284)

I have thought about the negatives, seeing those you love, who cannot continue, or decide not to an only live out to their unassisted biological age, at maximum, die - that would not be great. But, it would be what would happen.

I trust everyone to do what they will do.

I trust that I do not lie to myself. I will not lie to me. If I'm going to eat something bad, then I make sure I know that I am violating a rule to myself that I said I would never break. That I am doing it without lying to myself, but if I made the rule to never do it, then doing it would be a violation of the rule, hereby making me a liar to myself. See rule 1 - Do not lie to yourself.

I have made comments in the past about you can lie to everyone else, just don't lie to yourself. LIke a fart in church, that came around to me and it happened. The comment was not very nice. and had me at the center in a past family conflict, cause I admit it, I lied to someone.

I did it on purpose to&nbsp;forward or advance my position. I did it 100% and take full responsibility for everything. Bringing that into real estate is a further blessing.

Why now? Why then? When I decided that I was going to be brutally honest, that was the beginning of my journey. But not the decision itself, I had made that decision many times in the past. No, it was the fact I was doing the world. I was not telling anyone this is what I'm going to do. I was not informing the public of my next new adventure. I kept it off of the books and looking back, those events not telling a soul your plans, and I mean no one. Keeping it from your higher power - really.

IF you can do that this time, publish the results after. LIke in my case, use it to bring about attention to addiction and the journey. Getting to the journey is the part where most neglect. They think of their fat loss ending in a gold, or finishing at some point. They tell someone, that someone tells you, "I'm happy for you, I'm here to support you and what do you need from me?". After they say this, you have about a 90 percent chance of not doing anything cause you just got the attention you wanted.

You are a secret agent, your captors want to keep you fat, you will do anything, even faking the eating of bad food to make it work this time.

If you said you'd fast for the next 24 hours, you can be rude when your mom offers you a donut, or you can duck and cover, not eating it and not being rude or telling her your intension.

And this just crossed into my brain. This is not meant to kill yourself. Do your research and vet the information with your doctor. If they say that you need to tell the world your every move. Get a second and third opinion. You should not take my word for it.

I'm going by what my experiences have been, and I just layed myself out in this post, who'd do that in the first place. Double check my figures please.&nbsp; I sell homes and real estate. I represent home buyers and home sellers. I am a fee based business and I work for the brokerage known as Realty-One-Group - Success. in Valencia CA 01238257 is my CALDRE number.

BE well - I'm Connor with honor, over and out.
