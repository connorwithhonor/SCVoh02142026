# Why Your Final Walkthrough Could Save or Sink Your Santa Clarita Home Purchase

**TL;DR**: The final walkthrough in a Santa Clarita home purchase is your last chance to ensure the property is in the agreed-upon condition before closing. As a former LAPD officer turned realtor (CALDRE 01238257), I’ve seen it all – from tenants refusing to leave to sellers leaving behind a mess. This 5,000+ word guide dives into why the final walkthrough matters, how to approach it strategically, and what to do if things go wrong.

## Introduction: The Final Walkthrough – Your Last Line of Defense

Buying a home in Santa Clarita is a big deal. You’ve navigated the emotional rollercoaster of finding the right property, securing financing, and negotiating terms. Now, you’re days away from closing, and there’s one last step that could make or break the deal: the **final walkthrough**. This isn’t just a casual stroll through your soon-to-be home. It’s a critical checkpoint to verify the property’s condition, ensure agreed-upon repairs are done, and confirm the seller is holding up their end of the bargain.

As someone who’s walked the streets as an LAPD officer and now navigates the real estate jungle as a top-tier Santa Clarita realtor, I’ve seen what happens when buyers skip or mishandle this step. From tenants squatting post-closing to sellers leaving behind garbage or unrepaired damage, the final walkthrough is your chance to catch red flags before you’re stuck with them. In this guide, I’ll break down everything you need to know about the final walkthrough, drawing from my decades of experience and insider knowledge of the Santa Clarita real estate market.

Let’s dive into why this step is non-negotiable, how to execute it like a pro, and what to do if things go sideways. Whether you’re eyeing homes in Valencia, Saugus, or Canyon Country, this is your roadmap to closing with confidence. Want to see the latest listings?

## Why the Final Walkthrough Matters in Santa Clarita Real Estate

The final walkthrough is often misunderstood as a formality, but it’s far from it. In Santa Clarita, where inventory is tightening (down from 810 to 775 active listings as of August 21, 2025), and competition can be fierce, ensuring the home you’re buying matches what you agreed to is critical. Here’s why:

### 1. Verify Property Condition

The final walkthrough confirms that the home is in the same (or better) condition as when you made your offer. Sellers can be sloppy, especially in a hot market like Santa Clarita, where multiple offers are common. Maybe they punched holes in the walls while moving out or left the garage full of junk. Without a walkthrough, you’re rolling the dice.

### 2. Confirm Agreed-Upon Repairs

If you negotiated repairs during escrow – say, a new air conditioner or fixed roof tiles – the walkthrough ensures they were done properly by licensed professionals, not the seller’s cousin who took a Home Depot class. You don’t want to discover shoddy work after you’ve signed the papers.

### 3. Check for Unexpected Surprises

I’ve seen it all: tenants refusing to leave, flooded basements, or even missing appliances that were supposed to stay. In one case, I represented a buyer in the San Fernando Valley where the tenants were still lounging on the couch during the walkthrough, with no intention of moving. A quick call to the listing agent and some firm negotiation got them packing within hours. Without that walkthrough, my buyer would’ve been stuck with a legal nightmare.

### 4. Protect Your Investment

Santa Clarita homes aren’t cheap. With prices steady but not declining (unlike some Midwest markets), you’re likely investing hundreds of thousands, if not over a million, in areas like Stevenson Ranch or Valencia. The walkthrough is your last chance to ensure you’re getting what you paid for before the deal closes.

## The Santa Clarita Market Context: Why Timing and Strategy Matter

As of August 21, 2025, Santa Clarita’s real estate market is in a unique spot. Inventory is down to 775 active listings, a drop from 810, signaling a tightening market. Despite this, prices remain steady, with marginal increases at best. However, if the Federal Reserve cuts rates significantly, we could see a surge in buyer activity and sellers breaking free from their “golden handcuffs” – those ultra-low interest rates keeping them from listing.

This dynamic makes the final walkthrough even more critical. With competition heating up and properties potentially receiving multiple offers (reminiscent of the early 2000s frenzy), buyers need to be vigilant. A rushed or skipped walkthrough could leave you with a home that doesn’t meet expectations, especially if sellers are cutting corners to capitalize on demand.

## How to Conduct a Final Walkthrough Like a Pro

Here’s a step-by-step guide to nailing your final walkthrough in Santa Clarita, based on my experience as a first-responder-turned-realtor who’s closed deals since 1998.

### Step 1: Schedule It Close to Closing

Timing is everything. Schedule the walkthrough as close to the closing date as possible – ideally within 1-2 days of funding. This minimizes the chance of new damage or issues cropping up. In Santa Clarita, where properties can move fast, you want to ensure the home hasn’t been neglected since your last visit.

### Step 2: Bring Your Documentation

Arm yourself with:

	- **The Purchase Agreement**: To confirm what’s included (appliances, fixtures, etc.).

	- **Inspection Reports**: To check that agreed-upon repairs were made.

	- **Video or Photos from Earlier Visits**: A video walkthrough from the initial inspection or offer stage is gold. It helps you spot new damage, like scratched banisters or broken windows, that might not be in the inspection report.

	- **Repair Receipts**: If the seller was responsible for fixes, ask for receipts from licensed contractors to verify the work.

### Step 3: Check for Occupancy Issues

One of the biggest risks in Santa Clarita is tenants or owners refusing to vacate. I’ve seen tenant-occupied foreclosures where occupants dig in their heels, knowing eviction is a hassle. During the walkthrough:

	- Look for signs of packing (boxes, moving trucks).

	- If the property looks lived-in with no sign of moving, raise the alarm immediately. Call your agent to pause the escrow until the issue is resolved.

### Step 4: Inspect Repairs and Condition

Go through the property with a fine-tooth comb:

	- **Repairs**: Verify that all negotiated repairs (e.g., electrical panels, roof tiles, or plumbing) were done by licensed professionals. Check receipts and test systems (turn on the AC, flush toilets, etc.).

	- **Damage**: Look for new damage – holes in walls, scratched floors, or broken fixtures. Compare with your earlier video or photos.

	- **Cleanliness**: The home should be clean and free of trash. Sellers who leave a mess signal they don’t care about the deal’s integrity.

### Step 5: Confirm Included Items

The purchase agreement should specify what stays (e.g., appliances, light fixtures). Check that nothing’s been removed. I’ve seen sellers yank chandeliers or refrigerators they promised to leave, thinking buyers won’t notice.

### Step 6: Have Your Agent Advocate

Your buyer’s agent is your muscle here. If something’s wrong – say, a garage full of junk or a botched repair – your agent should immediately contact the listing agent. In Santa Clarita, where dual representation can muddy the waters, having your own agent ensures someone’s fighting for you. If the seller’s agent also represents you, they may hesitate to push back due to conflicting loyalties.

### Step 7: Document Everything

Take photos or videos during the walkthrough. If issues arise, this documentation is your evidence when negotiating with the seller or escrow company. It’s also useful if you need to delay closing or request concessions.

### Step 8: Know Your Enforcement Options

If the walkthrough reveals problems (e.g., unrepaired items, trash left behind), your agent can:

	- Request immediate fixes before funding.

	- Negotiate a credit or price reduction.

	- Pause escrow until the seller complies.

	- In extreme cases, cancel the transaction if the seller refuses to act.

Don’t sign the final walkthrough verification until you’re satisfied. Once you sign, it’s harder to hold the seller accountable.

## Common Walkthrough Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

Even seasoned buyers can trip up during the final walkthrough. Here are common mistakes and how to sidestep them:

### Pitfall 1: Skipping the Walkthrough

Some buyers assume everything’s fine and skip the walkthrough to save time. Big mistake. In Santa Clarita’s competitive market, sellers may cut corners, especially if they’re juggling multiple offers. Always do the walkthrough, no exceptions.

### Pitfall 2: Not Checking Repairs Thoroughly

If the seller promised to fix a broken window or electrical panel, don’t just take their word for it. Verify the work with receipts and test the systems. I once had a client discover a “repaired” AC unit was still broken because the seller used a shady contractor.

### Pitfall 3: Ignoring Occupancy Issues

Tenant-occupied properties or foreclosures are risky. If the occupants aren’t moving, you could be stuck with an eviction battle post-closing. During the walkthrough, confirm the property is vacant or that move-out plans are clear.

### Pitfall 4: Overlooking Cosmetic Damage

New scratches, dents, or stains might seem minor, but they can add up. Document everything and negotiate repairs or credits before closing. Your video from the inspection phase is your best friend here.

### Pitfall 5: Not Having Your Own Agent

Dual representation – where the listing agent also represents you – can compromise your interests. Your own buyer’s agent ensures someone’s solely focused on protecting you.

## The Role of Your Realtor: Why Experience Matters

As a former LAPD officer, I bring a protector’s mindset to real estate. My job isn’t just to find you a home; it’s to shield you from risks and fight for your best deal. During the final walkthrough, a seasoned realtor like me (CALDRE 01238257) will:

	- Spot issues you might miss, like shoddy repairs or missing fixtures.

	- Negotiate with the listing agent to resolve problems quickly.

	- Leverage local market knowledge to assess whether the seller’s actions align with Santa Clarita trends.

	- Protect your interests, especially in complex situations like foreclosures or tenant-occupied properties.

## Santa Clarita Market Insights: What’s Happening Now

As of August 21, 2025, here’s the lay of the land in Santa Clarita:

	- **Inventory**: 775 active listings, down from 810, indicating a tightening market.

	- **New Listings**: 77 new listings hit the market in the past week, with 10 “coming soon” properties not yet visible on syndication sites like Zillow.

	- **Price Changes**: 86 properties had price adjustments, signaling sellers are getting realistic.

	- **Escrow Cancellations**: 34 properties came back on the market after failed escrows, a sign that buyers are backing out due to issues like financing or inspections.

This data underscores the importance of the final walkthrough. With inventory tightening and competition heating up, you can’t afford to miss issues that could derail your purchase.

## Special Considerations for Santa Clarita Buyers

Santa Clarita’s diverse neighborhoods – from family-friendly Saugus to upscale Stevenson Ranch – each have unique quirks. Here’s how to tailor your walkthrough:

### Valencia

Known for its master-planned communities and amenities, Valencia homes often command premium prices. Check for HOA compliance during the walkthrough, as some sellers may neglect community rules, leaving you with fines post-closing.

### Saugus

Saugus is popular for its walkable schools and family-oriented vibe. Inspect for wear and tear, especially in older homes, and ensure any promised upgrades (e.g., new flooring) are complete.

### Canyon Country

With more affordable options, Canyon Country can attract first-time buyers. Be extra vigilant for deferred maintenance or tenant issues, as some properties may be rentals or foreclosures.

### Foreclosures and Short Sales

Santa Clarita has seen a rise in distressed properties. These deals can be tempting but risky. During the walkthrough, confirm the property is vacant and in the expected condition, as banks often sell “as-is” with little room for negotiation.

## What If Things Go Wrong? Enforcement and Next Steps

If the final walkthrough reveals issues, don’t panic. Here’s how to handle it:

### 1. Document the Problem

Take photos or videos and note discrepancies against the purchase agreement or inspection reports. This evidence strengthens your case.

### 2. Notify Your Agent Immediately

Your agent should contact the listing agent to demand fixes or concessions. In my experience, a firm but professional approach gets results fast. For example, in the tenant case I mentioned, a quick call to the listing agent sparked immediate action.

### 3. Negotiate Solutions

Options include:

	- **Repairs**: Demand the seller complete the work before closing.

	- **Credits**: Request a credit toward closing costs or repairs.

	- **Price Reduction**: If the damage is significant, negotiate a lower price.

	- **Delay Closing**: Pause escrow until the issues are resolved.

### 4. Consider Canceling

If the seller refuses to cooperate and the issues are deal-breakers (e.g., tenants won’t leave), you may need to cancel the transaction. Your agent can guide you through the process to protect your deposit.

### 5. Escrow as Your Ally

The escrow company acts as a neutral third party. If disputes arise, they can hold funds until issues are resolved, giving you leverage.

## Recap: Key Takeaways for Your Final Walkthrough

	- **Schedule Strategically**: Do the walkthrough 1-2 days before closing to minimize surprises.
