# 2025 is the year of the Open House - Santa Clarita Open Houses

Connor "with Honor" MacIvor - January 11, 2025** [0 Comments](/#comments) | [Add Comment](/#add-comment)
*Fatherly Voice, Worldly Wisdom, and a Dash of Sarcasm Just Between Us…*

Welcome, dear reader, to a deep dive into why I believe 2025 is shaping up to be the year of the open house—especially here in the beautiful Santa Clarita Valley (SCV). You may have heard the rumblings already: changes in commission structures, buyer representation twists, and all sorts of transformations in the real estate industry. If that sounds dry, stick with me, and I’ll do my best to keep it lively. After all, real estate is as much about the people—buyers and sellers—as it is about the properties, commissions, and fancy open-house pastries (yes, I see you eyeing those mini croissants).

But enough preamble. Let’s roll up our sleeves, put on our comfy shoes (or flip-flops, if that’s your style), and explore why open houses are poised to become even more central to the home-buying and selling process as we approach 2025. We’ll also delve into specific Santa Clarita neighborhoods—like Valencia, Saugus, Canyon Country, Newhall, Stevenson Ranch, and Castaic—so you know where to look and what to expect when heading out for your next open-house adventure.

Strap in for a **4,000+ word** ride. We’ll keep it thorough, we’ll keep it real, and I’ll do my best to pepper in a little wisdom gleaned from years of experience, plus the patience that comes from traveling the world and observing how markets shift over time. So let’s begin.

## 1. Setting the Stage for 2025

“2025 is probably gonna be the year of the open house.”

*—Direct from our transcript*

When talking about real estate, we often think in cyclical terms. Properties go up in value over long stretches, then down for corrections, and the commission models remain fairly consistent… until they’re not. The impetus for these changes can come from major lawsuits, new legislation, consumer outcry over fees, or economic shifts. In recent years, we’ve witnessed all sorts of external factors impacting how real estate transactions take place—from advances in technology and digital marketing to changes in buyer/seller expectations.

In **Santa Clarita**, a region known for its diverse housing stock, strong community vibes, and proximity to L.A., these shifting trends are felt quickly. By 2025, we expect:

	- **Greater transparency** in commissions, with more consumers aware of how agents are compensated.

	- **Growing desire** for open houses as a primary way to preview properties, now that not all listings guarantee a buyer’s agent commission.

	- **Evolving attitudes** toward dual agency (where one agent represents both buyer and seller).

Essentially, 2025 is shaping up to be the year in which open houses regain their former glory—and possibly surpass it.

## 2. Open House Statistics Before 2025

“Open house statistics prior to 2025 – anywhere from 2 to 7% nationally... That’s kind of the guessdiment.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

Historically, open houses have contributed a relatively small portion of closed transactions. Nationally, studies have shown that between **2% to 7%** of homebuyers found their home via an open house. That’s not a massive piece of the pie. However, as in our transcript’s analogy, *if your body has zero disease versus 2–7% disease, well, that’s a big difference.* In real estate terms, any chunk of the market can be significant if you position yourself well.

But that 2–7% figure might be set to increase if buyers decide to shop open houses more aggressively, especially in a climate where buyer’s agent commissions are not guaranteed. If a consumer has any doubt about whether they’ll need to pay a buyer’s agent out of their own pocket, they might go directly to open houses to see what’s out there—at least initially—before deciding on representation.

So, while 2–7% might sound small, there’s a strong case for that number growing as 2025 approaches. Combined with the fact that so much real estate research is now done online, open houses can be the perfect complement to a digital search strategy.

## 3. Why the Commission Structure Is Changing

“Let me tell you why the commission structure changed quite a bit... typically agents were dependent on the sellers paying their commission, now that has changed.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

The standard tradition in U.S. residential real estate has been for the seller to pay both the listing (seller’s) agent and the buyer’s agent out of the proceeds at closing. This means the seller’s agent negotiates a total commission (say 5–6%), and then splits that with the buyer’s agent. For a long time, that was standard practice—and it’s still quite common. But times change, and so do business models and legal frameworks.

Several high-profile lawsuits and regulatory changes have questioned whether sellers should be responsible for paying the buyer’s agent. Critics argue that it can inflate the total commission, or that buyers have limited clarity on how their agent is paid. Some brokerages and home-selling platforms have begun listing homes with zero or reduced buyer’s agent commissions, effectively shifting the burden onto the buyer.

As we inch closer to 2025, the outcome of these changes is a real estate market that is more flexible, more transparent, and in many cases more complicated—particularly for first-time homebuyers who may not fully grasp the commission structure. This shift also means:

	- Some sellers are offering reduced or even no commission to buyers’ agents.

	- Buyers might be asked to pay their agent directly, prompting them to search for properties in a way that reduces potential costs.

	- Agents must adapt their business models.

## 4. Buyer’s Agents and the “Seller-Pay” Commission Model

Let’s give a quick recap of how we got here. For decades, **buyer’s agents** depended on the listing broker’s offer of compensation (which ultimately came from the seller’s side) for their livelihood. This aligned with the idea that:

	- Sellers needed exposure to as many buyers as possible.

	- Offering a competitive buyer’s agent commission was the best way to guarantee exposure, cooperation, and showings.

	- Buyers effectively hired their agent at no direct cost to them.

Now, if more sellers in 2025 decide not to offer a buyer’s agent commission, we can see two possible outcomes:

	- **More buyers might forego using a buyer’s agent** (at least initially), figuring they can just pop into open houses or check online listings themselves. They might decide to adopt a “DIY approach” to real estate.

	- **Buyers might hire their own agent on a fee basis**, paying directly out of pocket for representation. This is a big shift from what many buyers are used to.

Between those two extremes are plenty of variations. Some sellers will still offer a buyer’s agent commission, and others might not. It may vary by region or property type. But collectively, it has the potential to make **open houses** more critical, since those events provide direct buyer-seller-agent interaction.

## 5. How Commission Changes Influence Open Houses

“That dynamic is starting to cause a little bit of a shift where it’s not as guaranteed as it was before... so it’s gonna be happening, as people start looking at more properties, previewing them at open houses, and then making a decision.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

An **open house** is basically a real estate open-door policy, giving prospective buyers a chance to see the property without scheduling a formal showing. It has historically served multiple purposes:

	- **Marketing**: For the seller, it’s a way to showcase the home to drive interest.

	- **Lead Generation**: For the listing agent, it’s a chance to meet prospective buyers who might not have representation.

	- **Ease of Access**: For buyers, it’s a convenient way to see a property.

Now, as the transcripts and changes suggest, open houses may become the first line of property touring for many buyers. Instead of calling an agent, scheduling a showing, and possibly paying for that agent’s time (or worrying about whether the seller is covering the commission), the buyer can simply drop by on a Sunday afternoon. If the house suits them, they can then decide how to proceed.

For sellers, hosting a well-planned open house in this new environment might be more important than ever, because it might be the first and best chance to capture a pool of buyers who are uncertain about hiring their own buyer’s agent or are just starting their search.

## 6. The Rise of “Dual Agency” and Its Pitfalls

“Should I use the agent that’s representing the seller?... That agent already has a vested interest in the transaction.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

As commission practices shift, more buyers might consider using the listing agent (the seller’s representative) to handle the entire deal. This is called **dual agency**, and it means the agent is representing both sides in the same transaction. In some states, dual agency is restricted or heavily regulated; in others, it’s allowed but can be tricky.

Why can it be tricky? Because an agent who has **fiduciary duties** to the seller—like getting them the best price—can’t simultaneously promise to get the best price for the buyer. It creates an inherent conflict of interest. While some agents handle dual agency ethically and responsibly, many real estate professionals discourage buyers from relying on the listing agent to represent them fully.

Here are a few pitfalls of dual agency:

	- **Limited Advocacy**: A dual agent must remain neutral, so the buyer won’t receive the same level of advocacy.

	- **Possible Confusion**: Buyers might misunderstand whose interests are being served.

	- **Negotiating Power**: If one agent is trying to negotiate for both parties, how can they push for the absolute best terms for either side?

By 2025, if more buyers wander into open houses without representation, the temptation to go with the listing agent—who is there, readily available—may rise. But, as we move through that year, we expect many informed buyers will realize that independent representation offers stronger negotiation power and better advocacy. This is one reason why after visiting an open house, a buyer might say, “Thanks, but I’m going to find my own agent.”

## 7. Why Buyers May Seek Their Own Representation

“Then the other question would be, maybe I should get my own agent. Then they’re gonna start searching online, trying to find other agents that can represent them.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

Despite the potential cost (in instances where the buyer pays some or all of their agent’s commission), working with a **dedicated buyer’s agent** can be a big boon for buyers. We’re talking about:

	- Having someone who can schedule and coordinate showings conveniently.

	- Having someone who can scour the MLS (Multiple Listing Service) and off-market listings for options, rather than solely relying on open houses.

	- Gaining an ally in negotiations—someone who is ethically and legally required to look out for the buyer’s best interests.

	- Tapping into expert advice on inspections, disclosures, and the local market climate.

Buyers want to walk into a transaction with all the facts. Even if they explore open houses independently at first, they may soon decide that going it alone is risky, particularly with the complexity and size of a real estate deal. This leads them back to the question, “How do I find a good buyer’s agent?”—and often, the first step to answering that question is an **online search**.

## 8. Harnessing the Power of Online Search

“And then take it from there.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

In today’s digital age, buyers aren’t just picking any random name out of the phone book (if those still exist!). They’re going online, doing thorough research, reading reviews, scouring websites like [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com), and checking out Google reviews or Yelp scores. They might also look for hyper-local agents who specialize in their target neighborhood—like Valencia open houses if that’s where they want to buy.

Open houses aside, buyers generally want data and transparency, which they can often find through real estate websites, social media channels, local forums, and agent listing platforms. The more information an agent or brokerage offers online, the more likely a buyer is to trust them. By the time a buyer steps foot in your open house (if you’re a seller or a listing agent), they may already know a fair amount about the property and your approach to commissions. 2025 will see an even stronger emphasis on easily accessible, user-friendly online platforms that showcase homes, open house schedules, and relevant neighborhood stats.

## 9. Local Market Spotlight: Santa Clarita Valley

“Don’t fall behind. Make sure you check out Santa Clarita Openhouses, connect with our team.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

Now, let’s shift gears and focus on Santa Clarita Valley specifically. I’ve traveled extensively—both physically and through the labyrinth of real estate markets across the country—and let me tell you: SCV is a gem. Each community in the valley has its own personality, from the suburban atmosphere of Valencia to the ranch-style vibe of Castaic. If you’re searching in Santa Clarita, you’ll want to keep an eye on each neighborhood’s open houses, as well as local market trends.

Here’s a breakdown of the Santa Clarita communities you might explore:

### Valencia

Often considered the heart of Santa Clarita, Valencia is known for its well-manicured neighborhoods, shopping centers, and strong school districts. Open houses here are typically well-attended and can get competitive if the property is priced right. If you’re interested in a more master-planned environment with walkable paseos, you’ll definitely want to keep an eye on Valencia open houses.

### Saugus

Saugus retains a more “local” feel, often with slightly larger lot sizes in certain areas. You can find various property types—condos, single-family homes, and even some larger ranch-style estates. If you want a cozy community vibe, checking out Saugus open houses might be the ticket.

### Canyon Country

As one of the largest and most diverse areas in Santa Clarita, Canyon Country offers a wide range of property sizes, styles, and price ranges. Canyon Country has both newer subdivisions and older, more established neighborhoods. Keep tabs on Canyon Country open houses for a taste of everything from starter homes to multi-acre ranch properties.

### Newhall

Newhall is the oldest community in the Santa Clarita Valley, rich with history and cultural attractions like the William S. Hart Park. It has a charming downtown area, known as Old Town Newhall, with local shops, restaurants, and an arts scene. If you’re searching for a home that combines a historical vibe with modern amenities, keep a close eye on Newhall open houses.

### Stevenson Ranch

Stevenson Ranch is often considered an upscale pocket of SCV, with easy freeway access, top-rated schools, and some larger single-family properties set against picturesque hills. It’s also close to major shopping centers and golf courses. For those seeking an executive-style home in a convenient location, Stevenson Ranch open houses are worth your weekend outing.

### Castaic

Finally, there’s Castaic, which sits near Castaic Lake and offers a more rural or suburban-rural blend. You can find everything from cozy starter homes to larger properties with RV parking and easy lake access for boating and recreation. If you crave a touch of nature, add Castaic open houses to your list.

## 10. The Benefits of Hosting and Attending Open Houses

Open houses have been around forever, but in this shifting climate, they take on renewed importance. Let’s dissect the benefits for both **buyers** and **sellers**:

### For Buyers

	- **Low-Pressure Environment**: You can walk in, look around, and leave without feeling obligated to sign anything.

	- **Immediate Impressions**: Sometimes, photos online can be misleading. Seeing the property in person, you get to experience the vibe, the neighborhood, the layout, the sunlight, etc.

	- **Chance to Compare**: If you dedicate a weekend to open houses, you can compare multiple properties back-to-back.

	- **Face-to-Face Interactions**: You can meet the listing agent, ask questions, and perhaps glean insights you can’t get from a website.

### For Sellers

	- **Showcasing the Home**: Great staging can highlight a property’s strengths, from a spacious floor plan to newly remodeled features.

	- **Generating Buyer Leads**: Even if attendees aren’t interested in this particular listing, they might become future clients.

	- **Creating Buzz**: A well-publicized open house can draw in foot traffic and even incite a sense of urgency in buyers.

	- **Real-Time Feedback**: Sellers and listing agents can gather direct feedback from potential buyers—are they put off by the busy street, or do they love the backyard?

In a market where commissions are less certain, both parties may rely even more on these open events to facilitate transactions or at least begin the conversation.

## 11. Strategies for Buyers to Maximize an Open House Visit

If you, dear reader, are a buyer venturing into the open-house scene in 2025, consider the following tips to make the most of your time:

	- **Plan Your Route**: Check [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com) for open house schedules. Map out a logical route so you don’t waste time crisscrossing the valley.

	- **Arrive Early or Late**: If an open house is from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., arriving right at 1 p.m. or just before 4 p.m. can sometimes allow for a more relaxed viewing experience.

	- **Ask Questions**: Don’t be shy. Ask about the neighborhood, past renovations, average utilities, HOA fees, and so on.

	- **Observe Other Visitors**: Sometimes, overhearing others’ questions or watching their reactions can highlight issues or perks you might have missed.

	- **Be Respectful**: It’s someone’s home, even if it’s on the market. Avoid opening drawers or being overly invasive. It’s one thing to check the closet space, but quite another to rummage through personal belongings.

	- **Take Notes**: If you plan to see multiple open houses in one day, it’s easy to forget details. Keep a small notebook or use your phone to jot down quick impressions.

In 2025, this approach is likely to be even more crucial—because if you decide not to hire an agent right off the bat, you’ll want to ensure you’re covering all the angles on your own.

## 12. Strategies for Sellers to Make Their Open House Count

As a seller in a shifting market, you’ll want to adapt. You might not get as many private showings if buyers hesitate to commit to an agent. So your open house might be your single best chance to showcase your property to unrepresented or casually searching buyers. Here are some pointers:

	- **Stage Wisely**: Hire a professional stager if possible, or at least declutter and remove personal items. Help buyers imagine their future in the home.

	- **Set the Right Mood**: Soft music, pleasant smells (but nothing overpowering), and comfortable lighting can go a long way.

	- **Market the Event**: Feature the open house on [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com), social media, local real estate Facebook groups, and yard signs. A sign spinner might be overkill—but hey, it never hurts to stand out if your budget allows!

	- **Have Info Packets Ready**: Include property details, local school information, neighborhood amenities, and any relevant documents (recent upgrades, warranties, etc.).

	- **Be Welcoming but Not Hovering**: If you’re present, greet folks warmly, but let them explore at their own pace. If you’re not comfortable hosting, let your listing agent handle it.

	- **Collect Feedback**: Encourage visitors to leave comments or fill out a quick survey. It might reveal small but fixable deterrents (like a pet odor you’ve gone nose-blind to).

## 13. Leveraging [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com) for Success

Ultimately, the more you equip yourself with accurate info, the less likely you are to be blindsided by the changes.

## 14. Predictions and Trends for 2025 and Beyond

Let’s indulge in a little fortune-telling (or, more accurately, informed speculation) about 2025 and beyond:

	- **Open Houses Become Social Events**: Expect more “mega open houses,” complete with refreshments, local business partnerships, and maybe even live entertainment on special occasions. In a changing commission environment, these events are prime lead generation opportunities.

	- **Tech Integration**: From virtual tours (for those who can’t physically attend) to QR-coded property details you can scan on the spot, open houses will embrace technology to cater to a wide range of buyers.

	- **Commission Negotiations Go Public**: As transparency takes hold, buyers and sellers might discuss commissions more openly, and some listing services may display exactly how much is being offered to a buyer’s agent.

	- **Buyers’ Agents Will Adapt**: If fewer sellers pay the buyer’s agent commission, successful buyer’s agents will pivot their marketing to show the value they bring—like negotiation expertise, local connections, and contract know-how—justifying a possible out-of-pocket payment by the buyer.

	- **“Try Before You Buy” Brokerage Models**: Some brokerages might roll out programs where buyers pay a small retainer for representation, which can then be credited back at closing if the seller pays partial commission or if the final purchase price allows for it.

It’s both an exciting and uncertain time. Don’t let that deter you. In fact, if you know how to leverage it, you can get ahead of the game.

## 15. Q&amp;A: Common Concerns About the 2025 Real Estate Landscape

**Q**: Will sellers still pay buyer’s agents in 2025?

**A**: Many will, but not all. It may depend on the region, local customs, and how much leverage the seller feels they have. If the seller’s market is hot, they might see no need to offer a buyer’s agent commission. If it’s more balanced or a buyer’s market, they might entice buyer’s agents to show the property by offering commission.

**Q**: Won’t buyers always want a free buyer’s agent?

**A**: Everyone loves “free,” but as real estate evolves, buyers may come to see paying for representation as akin to hiring a lawyer or financial advisor. They might prefer choosing and paying the best agent for the job, rather than one who only works for the fee the seller is willing to offer.

**Q**: Are open houses really effective for selling my home?

**A**: It depends. While some critics argue that open houses primarily benefit listing agents by generating leads, they can be very effective in a shifting market where more buyers rely on them to see properties without an agent. Well-advertised open houses can drive competition and lead to multiple offers, especially in desirable areas like Santa Clarita.

**Q**: What if I don’t feel comfortable going to an open house alone?

**A**: While 2025 might see more independent buyers, there’s no rule against bringing a friend, family member, or even a trusted agent. Just because an open house is open to the public doesn’t mean you have to be by yourself.

**Q**: Do I risk losing a property by waiting for an open house rather than scheduling a showing?

**A**: In a hot market, that can happen. Some properties will accept an offer before the open house even takes place. If you’ve fallen in love with a particular listing online, consider scheduling a private tour. But if you’re just starting your search, open houses can be a great, low-pressure way to get a feel for what’s out there.

## 16. Conclusion: Stay Ahead of the Curve

“I believe 2025 is going to be the year of the open house. Don’t fall behind—make sure you check out Santa Clarita Openhouses.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

Let’s circle back to our transcript’s main theme: **2025 is shaping up to be the year of the open house**. If you’ve stuck with me through these 4,000 words (give or take!), I hope you feel a bit more informed—and maybe even a little excited—about the opportunities that lie ahead. Whether you’re a prospective buyer, a seasoned seller, or an agent navigating these changes, knowledge is your best weapon.

Here’s the bottom line:

	- **Commissions are changing**, and this will influence how buyers and sellers connect.

	- **Open houses** offer a direct, no-strings-attached way for buyers to see homes and for sellers to generate foot traffic.

	- **Santa Clarita** remains a thriving real estate market, with each neighborhood—Valencia, Saugus, Canyon Country, Newhall, Stevenson Ranch, and Castaic—offering its own unique flavor and opportunities.

	- **Online resources** like [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com) will be crucial for staying updated in real time, scheduling efficient home tours, and connecting with knowledgeable professionals who can guide you through the new commission landscape.

As someone who’s traveled the world and seen many markets, I’m telling you: The future favors those who adapt, stay informed, and keep a positive, proactive mindset. If you’re a buyer, don’t be afraid to attend open houses, ask questions, and consider hiring an agent you trust—whether their fee is paid by the seller or by you. If you’re a seller, remember that hosting an open house in 2025 might be more important than ever, because a significant slice of buyers may start their search there rather than jumping into a buyer’s agency agreement from day one.

In closing, real estate is about people, relationships, and building a future. Yes, there are legalities, fees, contracts, and negotiations involved. But at the end of the day, it’s about finding that right home or making that right deal that sets you on a path to happiness, financial stability, or both. As the wise old father figure I aim to be in these digital pages, I’d say: Embrace the change, learn the rules of the new game, and then go forth and win. If the real estate world is your oyster, let 2025 be the year you crack it open—and maybe find a pearl inside.

Thank you for reading, and if you need more information, guidance, or even just a friendly chat about the Santa Clarita real estate market, remember that we at [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com) are here to help.
