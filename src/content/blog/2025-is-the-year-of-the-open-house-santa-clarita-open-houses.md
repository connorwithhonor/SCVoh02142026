# 2025 is the year of the Open House - Santa Clarita Open Houses

Connor "with Honor" MacIvor - January 11, 2025** [0 Comments](/#comments) | [Add Comment](/#add-comment)
*Fatherly Voice, Worldly Wisdom, and a Dash of Sarcasm Just Between Us…*

Welcome, dear reader, to a deep dive into why I believe 2025 is shaping up to be the year of the open house—especially here in the beautiful Santa Clarita Valley (SCV). You may have heard the rumblings already: changes in commission structures, buyer representation twists, and all sorts of transformations in the real estate industry. If that sounds dry, stick with me, and I’ll do my best to keep it lively. After all, real estate is as much about the people—buyers and sellers—as it is about the properties, commissions, and fancy open-house pastries (yes, I see you eyeing those mini croissants).

But enough preamble. Let’s roll up our sleeves, put on our comfy shoes (or flip-flops, if that’s your style), and explore why open houses are poised to become even more central to the home-buying and selling process as we approach 2025. We’ll also delve into specific Santa Clarita neighborhoods—like Valencia, Saugus, Canyon Country, Newhall, Stevenson Ranch, and Castaic—so you know where to look and what to expect when heading out for your next open-house adventure.

Strap in for a **4,000+ word** ride. We’ll keep it thorough, we’ll keep it real, and I’ll do my best to pepper in a little wisdom gleaned from years of experience, plus the patience that comes from traveling the world and observing how markets shift over time. So let’s begin.

## Table of Contents

Now, settle in with your coffee, tea, or bottled water—maybe skip the tequila—and let’s talk real estate.

## 1. Setting the Stage for 2025

“2025 is probably gonna be the year of the open house.”

*—Direct from our transcript*

When talking about real estate, we often think in cyclical terms. Properties go up in value over long stretches, then down for corrections, and the commission models remain fairly consistent… until they’re not. The impetus for these changes can come from major lawsuits, new legislation, consumer outcry over fees, or economic shifts. In recent years, we’ve witnessed all sorts of external factors impacting how real estate transactions take place—from advances in technology and digital marketing to changes in buyer/seller expectations.

In **Santa Clarita**, a region known for its diverse housing stock, strong community vibes, and proximity to L.A., these shifting trends are felt quickly. By 2025, we expect:

Essentially, 2025 is shaping up to be the year in which open houses regain their former glory—and possibly surpass it.

## 2. Open House Statistics Before 2025

“Open house statistics prior to 2025 – anywhere from 2 to 7% nationally... That’s kind of the guessdiment.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

Historically, open houses have contributed a relatively small portion of closed transactions. Nationally, studies have shown that between **2% to 7%** of homebuyers found their home via an open house. That’s not a massive piece of the pie. However, as in our transcript’s analogy, *if your body has zero disease versus 2–7% disease, well, that’s a big difference.* In real estate terms, any chunk of the market can be significant if you position yourself well.

But that 2–7% figure might be set to increase if buyers decide to shop open houses more aggressively, especially in a climate where buyer’s agent commissions are not guaranteed. If a consumer has any doubt about whether they’ll need to pay a buyer’s agent out of their own pocket, they might go directly to open houses to see what’s out there—at least initially—before deciding on representation.

So, while 2–7% might sound small, there’s a strong case for that number growing as 2025 approaches. Combined with the fact that so much real estate research is now done online, open houses can be the perfect complement to a digital search strategy.

## 3. Why the Commission Structure Is Changing

“Let me tell you why the commission structure changed quite a bit... typically agents were dependent on the sellers paying their commission, now that has changed.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

The standard tradition in U.S. residential real estate has been for the seller to pay both the listing (seller’s) agent and the buyer’s agent out of the proceeds at closing. This means the seller’s agent negotiates a total commission (say 5–6%), and then splits that with the buyer’s agent. For a long time, that was standard practice—and it’s still quite common. But times change, and so do business models and legal frameworks.

Several high-profile lawsuits and regulatory changes have questioned whether sellers should be responsible for paying the buyer’s agent. Critics argue that it can inflate the total commission, or that buyers have limited clarity on how their agent is paid. Some brokerages and home-selling platforms have begun listing homes with zero or reduced buyer’s agent commissions, effectively shifting the burden onto the buyer.

As we inch closer to 2025, the outcome of these changes is a real estate market that is more flexible, more transparent, and in many cases more complicated—particularly for first-time homebuyers who may not fully grasp the commission structure. This shift also means:

## 4. Buyer’s Agents and the “Seller-Pay” Commission Model

Let’s give a quick recap of how we got here. For decades, **buyer’s agents** depended on the listing broker’s offer of compensation (which ultimately came from the seller’s side) for their livelihood. This aligned with the idea that:

Now, if more sellers in 2025 decide not to offer a buyer’s agent commission, we can see two possible outcomes:

Between those two extremes are plenty of variations. Some sellers will still offer a buyer’s agent commission, and others might not. It may vary by region or property type. But collectively, it has the potential to make **open houses** more critical, since those events provide direct buyer-seller-agent interaction.

## 5. How Commission Changes Influence Open Houses

“That dynamic is starting to cause a little bit of a shift where it’s not as guaranteed as it was before... so it’s gonna be happening, as people start looking at more properties, previewing them at open houses, and then making a decision.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

An **open house** is basically a real estate open-door policy, giving prospective buyers a chance to see the property without scheduling a formal showing. It has historically served multiple purposes:

Now, as the transcripts and changes suggest, open houses may become the first line of property touring for many buyers. Instead of calling an agent, scheduling a showing, and possibly paying for that agent’s time (or worrying about whether the seller is covering the commission), the buyer can simply drop by on a Sunday afternoon. If the house suits them, they can then decide how to proceed.

For sellers, hosting a well-planned open house in this new environment might be more important than ever, because it might be the first and best chance to capture a pool of buyers who are uncertain about hiring their own buyer’s agent or are just starting their search.

## 6. The Rise of “Dual Agency” and Its Pitfalls

“Should I use the agent that’s representing the seller?... That agent already has a vested interest in the transaction.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

As commission practices shift, more buyers might consider using the listing agent (the seller’s representative) to handle the entire deal. This is called **dual agency**, and it means the agent is representing both sides in the same transaction. In some states, dual agency is restricted or heavily regulated; in others, it’s allowed but can be tricky.

Why can it be tricky? Because an agent who has **fiduciary duties** to the seller—like getting them the best price—can’t simultaneously promise to get the best price for the buyer. It creates an inherent conflict of interest. While some agents handle dual agency ethically and responsibly, many real estate professionals discourage buyers from relying on the listing agent to represent them fully.

Here are a few pitfalls of dual agency:

By 2025, if more buyers wander into open houses without representation, the temptation to go with the listing agent—who is there, readily available—may rise. But, as we move through that year, we expect many informed buyers will realize that independent representation offers stronger negotiation power and better advocacy. This is one reason why after visiting an open house, a buyer might say, “Thanks, but I’m going to find my own agent.”

## 7. Why Buyers May Seek Their Own Representation

“Then the other question would be, maybe I should get my own agent. Then they’re gonna start searching online, trying to find other agents that can represent them.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

Despite the potential cost (in instances where the buyer pays some or all of their agent’s commission), working with a **dedicated buyer’s agent** can be a big boon for buyers. We’re talking about:

Buyers want to walk into a transaction with all the facts. Even if they explore open houses independently at first, they may soon decide that going it alone is risky, particularly with the complexity and size of a real estate deal. This leads them back to the question, “How do I find a good buyer’s agent?”—and often, the first step to answering that question is an **online search**.

## 8. Harnessing the Power of Online Search

“And then take it from there.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

In today’s digital age, buyers aren’t just picking any random name out of the phone book (if those still exist!). They’re going online, doing thorough research, reading reviews, scouring websites like [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com), and checking out Google reviews or Yelp scores. They might also look for hyper-local agents who specialize in their target neighborhood—like Valencia open houses if that’s where they want to buy.

Open houses aside, buyers generally want data and transparency, which they can often find through real estate websites, social media channels, local forums, and agent listing platforms. The more information an agent or brokerage offers online, the more likely a buyer is to trust them. By the time a buyer steps foot in your open house (if you’re a seller or a listing agent), they may already know a fair amount about the property and your approach to commissions. 2025 will see an even stronger emphasis on easily accessible, user-friendly online platforms that showcase homes, open house schedules, and relevant neighborhood stats.

## 9. Local Market Spotlight: Santa Clarita Valley

“Don’t fall behind. Make sure you check out Santa Clarita Openhouses, connect with our team.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

Now, let’s shift gears and focus on Santa Clarita Valley specifically. I’ve traveled extensively—both physically and through the labyrinth of real estate markets across the country—and let me tell you: SCV is a gem. Each community in the valley has its own personality, from the suburban atmosphere of Valencia to the ranch-style vibe of Castaic. If you’re searching in Santa Clarita, you’ll want to keep an eye on each neighborhood’s open houses, as well as local market trends.

Here’s a breakdown of the Santa Clarita communities you might explore:

### Valencia

Often considered the heart of Santa Clarita, Valencia is known for its well-manicured neighborhoods, shopping centers, and strong school districts. Open houses here are typically well-attended and can get competitive if the property is priced right. If you’re interested in a more master-planned environment with walkable paseos, you’ll definitely want to keep an eye on Valencia open houses.

### Saugus

Saugus retains a more “local” feel, often with slightly larger lot sizes in certain areas. You can find various property types—condos, single-family homes, and even some larger ranch-style estates. If you want a cozy community vibe, checking out Saugus open houses might be the ticket.

### Canyon Country

As one of the largest and most diverse areas in Santa Clarita, Canyon Country offers a wide range of property sizes, styles, and price ranges. Canyon Country has both newer subdivisions and older, more established neighborhoods. Keep tabs on Canyon Country open houses for a taste of everything from starter homes to multi-acre ranch properties.

### Newhall

Newhall is the oldest community in the Santa Clarita Valley, rich with history and cultural attractions like the William S. Hart Park. It has a charming downtown area, known as Old Town Newhall, with local shops, restaurants, and an arts scene. If you’re searching for a home that combines a historical vibe with modern amenities, keep a close eye on Newhall open houses.

### Stevenson Ranch

Stevenson Ranch is often considered an upscale pocket of SCV, with easy freeway access, top-rated schools, and some larger single-family properties set against picturesque hills. It’s also close to major shopping centers and golf courses. For those seeking an executive-style home in a convenient location, Stevenson Ranch open houses are worth your weekend outing.

### Castaic

Finally, there’s Castaic, which sits near Castaic Lake and offers a more rural or suburban-rural blend. You can find everything from cozy starter homes to larger properties with RV parking and easy lake access for boating and recreation. If you crave a touch of nature, add Castaic open houses to your list.

## 10. The Benefits of Hosting and Attending Open Houses

Open houses have been around forever, but in this shifting climate, they take on renewed importance. Let’s dissect the benefits for both **buyers** and **sellers**:

### For Buyers

### For Sellers

In a market where commissions are less certain, both parties may rely even more on these open events to facilitate transactions or at least begin the conversation.

## 11. Strategies for Buyers to Maximize an Open House Visit

If you, dear reader, are a buyer venturing into the open-house scene in 2025, consider the following tips to make the most of your time:

In 2025, this approach is likely to be even more crucial—because if you decide not to hire an agent right off the bat, you’ll want to ensure you’re covering all the angles on your own.

## 12. Strategies for Sellers to Make Their Open House Count

As a seller in a shifting market, you’ll want to adapt. You might not get as many private showings if buyers hesitate to commit to an agent. So your open house might be your single best chance to showcase your property to unrepresented or casually searching buyers. Here are some pointers:

## 14. Predictions and Trends for 2025 and Beyond

It’s both an exciting and uncertain time. Don’t let that deter you. In fact, if you know how to leverage it, you can get ahead of the game.

## 15. Q&amp;A: Common Concerns About the 2025 Real Estate Landscape

**Q**: Will sellers still pay buyer’s agents in 2025?

**A**: Many will, but not all. It may depend on the region, local customs, and how much leverage the seller feels they have. If the seller’s market is hot, they might see no need to offer a buyer’s agent commission. If it’s more balanced or a buyer’s market, they might entice buyer’s agents to show the property by offering commission.

**Q**: Won’t buyers always want a free buyer’s agent?

**A**: Everyone loves “free,” but as real estate evolves, buyers may come to see paying for representation as akin to hiring a lawyer or financial advisor. They might prefer choosing and paying the best agent for the job, rather than one who only works for the fee the seller is willing to offer.

**Q**: Are open houses really effective for selling my home?

**A**: It depends. While some critics argue that open houses primarily benefit listing agents by generating leads, they can be very effective in a shifting market where more buyers rely on them to see properties without an agent. Well-advertised open houses can drive competition and lead to multiple offers, especially in desirable areas like Santa Clarita.

**Q**: What if I don’t feel comfortable going to an open house alone?

**A**: While 2025 might see more independent buyers, there’s no rule against bringing a friend, family member, or even a trusted agent. Just because an open house is open to the public doesn’t mean you have to be by yourself.

**Q**: Do I risk losing a property by waiting for an open house rather than scheduling a showing?

**A**: In a hot market, that can happen. Some properties will accept an offer before the open house even takes place. If you’ve fallen in love with a particular listing online, consider scheduling a private tour. But if you’re just starting your search, open houses can be a great, low-pressure way to get a feel for what’s out there.

## 16. Conclusion: Stay Ahead of the Curve

“I believe 2025 is going to be the year of the open house. Don’t fall behind—make sure you check out Santa Clarita Openhouses.”

*—Transcript excerpt*

Let’s circle back to our transcript’s main theme: **2025 is shaping up to be the year of the open house**. If you’ve stuck with me through these 4,000 words (give or take!), I hope you feel a bit more informed—and maybe even a little excited—about the opportunities that lie ahead. Whether you’re a prospective buyer, a seasoned seller, or an agent navigating these changes, knowledge is your best weapon.

Here’s the bottom line:

As someone who’s traveled the world and seen many markets, I’m telling you: The future favors those who adapt, stay informed, and keep a positive, proactive mindset. If you’re a buyer, don’t be afraid to attend open houses, ask questions, and consider hiring an agent you trust—whether their fee is paid by the seller or by you. If you’re a seller, remember that hosting an open house in 2025 might be more important than ever, because a significant slice of buyers may start their search there rather than jumping into a buyer’s agency agreement from day one.

In closing, real estate is about people, relationships, and building a future. Yes, there are legalities, fees, contracts, and negotiations involved. But at the end of the day, it’s about finding that right home or making that right deal that sets you on a path to happiness, financial stability, or both. As the wise old father figure I aim to be in these digital pages, I’d say: Embrace the change, learn the rules of the new game, and then go forth and win. If the real estate world is your oyster, let 2025 be the year you crack it open—and maybe find a pearl inside.
