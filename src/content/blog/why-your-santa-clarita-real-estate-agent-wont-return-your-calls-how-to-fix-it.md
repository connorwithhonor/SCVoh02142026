# Why Your Santa Clarita Real Estate Agent Won't Return Your Calls how to fix it.

**TL;DR:** Poor agent communication costs Santa Clarita homebuyers and sellers an average of $10K-$30K in missed negotiations and slower sales. Here's the truth: communication problems don't surface during interviews—they emerge mid-transaction when you're vulnerable. The solution isn't complicated. Establish written expectations before you sign anything. Ask about response times, availability protocols, and communication style. When you work with a vetted referral network like Santa Clarita Open Houses, these standards are already in place. You're not gambling. You're getting accountability.

## The Hidden Cost of Silent Agents: Why Communication Matters More Than You Think

If you're planning to hire a real estate agent in Santa Clarita Valley, you'll hear it mentioned everywhere: communication is key. But here's what most people don't realize—the communication problems don't show up at the beginning. Of course they don't.

When you first start interviewing agents, everyone's ready to communicate. Everyone's responsive. Everyone's enthusiastic about your property or your home search. The problem emerges later, once you're actually in the process. That's when questions start piling up. Real questions that need real answers.

And that's when some agents snap.

You'll get responses like, *"Look, I'm busy. I'm trying to sell your home. I'm trying to find you a buyer. I'm trying to locate listings for you. I don't have time for constant check-ins."*

Here's the truth: that's not an excuse. That's a red flag.

### The Communication Conversation Nobody Has Upfront

When you're interviewing an agent—any agent, even one I might recommend through Santa Clarita Open Houses—you need to have a direct conversation about communication style before you sign anything.

This isn't subtle. This isn't something you hint at. You ask:

	- **How long will it take you to get back to me when I call or text?**

	- **Are there specific times when you're unavailable?**

	- **How do you handle clients when you're with other clients?**

	- **What's your communication protocol when dealing with offers, inspections, or appraisals?**

These questions matter because they reveal character. They show you whether this person respects your time, or whether they see you as one transaction among many.

### The Court Metaphor: Why "I Was Busy" Doesn't Work in Real Estate

When I worked as a police officer with LAPD, we had legitimate scheduling constraints. Court appearances, for example. If I was scheduled to be at court at 8:30 AM, that was non-negotiable. I had to be there. Sometimes I'd have 20-30 minutes before the courtroom doors opened to take a phone call. Sometimes the DA or CA would grab me right before that window closed. I'd be pulled into a room, and suddenly I wasn't available.

That's a real constraint. That's unavoidable.

But here's the thing: real estate agents don't have that constraint. Unless an agent is literally testifying in a real estate-related court case (which is extraordinarily rare), they have availability. If they're not available, it's because they're with another client.

And that's actually fine—but it's a respect issue.

When I was selling real estate full-time, if I was sitting with a client and another call came in, I didn't pick up. Out of respect. If my phone rang, I'd ask the person in front of me: *"Do you mind if I grab this?"* Most of the time, they'd say no. This is your time. I'm here for you.

That's the standard I pass along to every agent in my network at Santa Clarita Open Houses. You come first. Always. One hundred percent.

But that only works if expectations are clear from day one.

### The Real Estate Agent Referral Advantage: Vetting the Communication Standard

This is where working with a referral network like Santa Clarita Open Houses becomes valuable. We don't just throw agents at you. We vet them.

When you come through our network looking for agent representation, we have a detailed Q&amp;A document that every referred agent commits to. Part of that document directly addresses communication expectations. We ask agents:

	- How do you structure your communication?

	- What's your average response time?

	- How do you prioritize client contact during critical transaction windows?

And here's the important part: we follow up. We get feedback from clients about whether agents lived up to those standards.

It's accountability. Four eyes on the process—yours, ours, the agent's, and the broader network's. You know you're not getting taken advantage of.

### The Buyer Broker Agreement: Another Communication Requirement

Beyond communication style, there's another critical conversation to have when hiring an agent: the buyer broker agreement (BBA), also called a buyer broker contract (BBC).

In many states now, including California, the buyer broker agreement is mandatory. You need to understand it before you sign it. Here are the questions to ask:

	- **Who's signing this agreement?**

	- **What am I agreeing to?**

	- **Who's paying the buyer's agent commission?**

	- **How long does this agreement last?**

	- **Can I terminate it early, and if so, under what conditions?**

This isn't just legal paperwork. This document shapes your entire agent relationship. If you're unclear about it, you'll have problems down the line.

On the selling side, you need the same clarity. What's the listing agent's commission? What services are you getting for that commission? How long is your listing agreement?

Understanding these frameworks upfront prevents misunderstandings later.

### Flat Fee Real Estate Services: The Tempting Alternative

You've probably heard about flat fee real estate services. Someone charges you a flat fee—say, $2,995—to sell your house, regardless of the selling price.

Here's what you need to know: this isn't new. Flat fee agents have been around for years. There are plenty of agents in my network at Santa Clarita Open Houses who offer this service.

But flat fee doesn't mean simple. You need to read the small print.

**Key questions about flat fee structures:**

	- **What's included in the flat fee?**

	
		Are we talking listing photos, description, MLS entry, and that's it?

		- Or are we talking open houses, showings, negotiation, closing coordination?

	

	
	- **Does the fee change based on circumstances?**
	
		If your house sells within the first three weeks, maybe the flat fee applies as stated.

		- But what if it takes eight weeks? Does the fee increase?

		- What if you get multiple offers and the agent has to manage a bidding war? Is there an additional fee?

	

	
	- **Does the fee scale with the sale price?**
	
		Some flat fee agents charge the same $2,995 whether you're selling a $500K house or a $2M house.

		- That's a massive value difference depending on your property.

	

	
	- **How does the agent get paid?**
	
		Are they taking the buyer's agent commission from the MLS listing?

		- Are you paying them directly?

		- Are both the buyer's agent and listing agent splitting standard commission, and you're just paying a reduced amount?

	

	

The advantage of working through a referral network for flat fee services is that someone else has already dug into these questions. You're getting agents who are transparent about their structure.

**Research pricing models:** [Flat Fee vs. Commission Real Estate Options](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/real-estate-pricing) | [Santa Clarita Market Reports &amp; Pricing](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/market-reports)

### The Value Question: Are You Getting What You Pay For?

This is the real test with flat fee services. Just because it's flat fee doesn't mean it's a good deal.

A conventional real estate agent typically earns 2.5-3% of the sale price on the buyer's side and another 2.5-3% on the seller's side. If you're selling a $600K house, that's around $30,000 in total commission, split between buyer's and seller's agents.

A flat fee agent charging $2,995 is keeping more of that commission. That's fine—but what service reduction comes with that?

Are you getting:

	- Multiple listing photos (or just a few)?

	- Professional staging advice?

	- Marketing on social media?

	- Open houses?

	- Proactive buyer outreach?

	- Negotiation experience?

Or are you getting a bare-bones listing entry that relies entirely on buyers finding you on the MLS?

The answer matters. If flat fee means you get professional photos, strong marketing, and a responsive agent, that's value. If flat fee means you get an MLS entry and hope for the best, you might leave $50,000+ on the table.

### The Real Estate Referral Network Difference

Here's where Santa Clarita Open Houses operates differently from Zillow, Redfin, or other platforms.

Those platforms are transaction machines. They match you with agents algorithmically. You get a list. You pick one. You hope for the best.

Santa Clarita Open Houses is a referral network with accountability. When I refer you to an agent, I'm putting my name on that referral. That agent knows they'll get feedback. That agent knows that poor communication, shady practices, or misrepresentation will damage my referral network.

It's not foolproof, but it's different.

You're not one of thousands. You're part of a vetted network where the agents understand they're being evaluated continuously.

### Questions to Ask Before You Hire Any Agent

Regardless of whether you work through a referral network or find an agent independently, here's your checklist:

**Communication &amp; Availability:**

	- What's your typical response time to client calls and emails?

	- Are there times during the day or week when you're generally unavailable?

	- If you're with another client, what's your process for returning messages?

	- How do you handle urgent situations?

**Representation &amp; Agreements:**

	- Can you walk me through the buyer broker agreement (or listing agreement) line by line?

	- Who pays the buyer's agent commission, and is that negotiable?

	- How long am I committed to working with you?

	- Can I terminate early if I'm unhappy?

**Services &amp; Deliverables:**

	- What specific services are included in your representation?

	- How many showings or open houses are typical for a listing like mine?

	- What marketing strategy will you use?

	- How often will you provide updates on activity?

**Costs &amp; Fees:**

	- What's your commission structure?

	- Are there any additional fees I should know about?

	- If this is a flat fee, what exactly does that cover?

	- How will costs change if the timeline extends or complications arise?

**Experience &amp; References:**

	- How many transactions have you completed in Santa Clarita Valley?

	- What's your average days on market for listings?

	- Can you provide references from recent clients?

	- Have you ever had licensing issues or complaints filed against you?

These questions aren't antagonistic. A good agent welcomes them. A good agent knows they can answer clearly and confidently.

### The Psychological Reality of Agent Selection

When you're hiring an agent, you're not just hiring a salesperson. You're hiring someone who will represent your interests under pressure.

Will they push back against a lowball offer, or will they encourage you to take it because they want the commission?

Will they communicate honestly if your house is overpriced, or will they list it at your inflated asking price knowing it won't sell?

Will they return your call within hours, or will you spend days wondering what's happening with your transaction?

The answers to these questions come down to character, communication standards, and accountability.

### Finding Your Agent Through Proper Vetting

When you're ready to be referred to an agent in Santa Clarita Valley, you have options. You can scroll Zillow. You can call Redfin. You can work through a referral network.

The advantage of a referral network—specifically, a network like Santa Clarita Open Houses that takes vetting seriously—is that the agent has already been evaluated. You're not the first person to work with them. Other clients have provided feedback.

It's not perfect. No system is. But it's better than rolling the dice with a stranger.

### The Anti-Zillow Model: Territorial Exclusivity and Accountability

Here's something most people don't know about real estate platforms: they're built to commoditize agents. You're shopping for agents the same way you shop for anything on Zillow. Name, photo, rating, click.

The Santa Clarita Open Houses model is different. Agents in the network aren't competing against each other directly for every listing. There's territorial thinking—your agent is your agent.

That changes behavior. If an agent knows they're going to work with you across multiple transactions, they care about long-term reputation more than short-term commission.

They communicate better. They return calls faster. They put in more effort because they know you'll refer them to friends and family.

### What Happens When Communication Fails

Let's talk about the actual cost of poor agent communication.

You submit an offer. Your agent goes silent. Three days pass. You don't know if the seller countered, if there's a problem, if you need to adjust something. You're anxious. You're checking your phone constantly.

Finally, your agent texts: "Still waiting to hear back."

Meanwhile, another buyer's offer came in. The seller countered to that offer first. You're playing from behind because you didn't have information.

Or this: your agent lists your house. Marketing stinks. Photos are terrible. No open houses scheduled. You message asking for updates. Response comes three days later: "Market's slow right now."

Six months later, you've reduced your price twice. Your agent finally admits the listing strategy was weak from day one. You've left $30,000 on the table because of poor communication and strategy.

Communication failures have real financial consequences.

### How to Ensure Communication Standards Are Met

If you hire an agent—through a referral network or independently—do this:

	- **Document the communication agreement.** Get it in writing. Email the agent: "Per our conversation, you'll respond to my calls within 24 hours and texts within 4 hours during business hours." Ask them to confirm.

	- **Set boundaries and expectations.** Tell them: "I don't need daily updates, but I need updates at key milestones: offer received, counteroffer, inspection, appraisal, final walkthrough."

	- **Use a consistent communication channel.** Decide: text, email, or phone? All three? Make it clear.

	- **Track responsiveness.** Keep notes on response times. If your agent consistently misses the agreed-upon windows, that's a problem to address.

	- **Address issues immediately.** Don't wait until closing to complain about communication. If it's not working two weeks in, have the conversation.

### The Bigger Picture: Why Real Estate Relationships Matter

You're not just hiring someone to list your house or show you properties. You're hiring someone who will be involved in one of the largest financial decisions of your life.

That person needs to communicate. They need to be responsive. They need to respect your time and your intelligence.

The good news: this standard is totally achievable. Plenty of agents operate this way. The better news: when you work through a vetted referral network, you're starting with agents who have already proven they can meet it.

### Final Thoughts: You Deserve Better Than Silence

If you're in Santa Clarita Valley and looking to hire a real estate agent, whether you're buying or selling, the communication conversation is non-negotiable.

Ask the questions. Get clear answers. Verify with references. Make sure you're working with someone who understands that your time matters and your questions deserve responses.

When you're ready to be referred to an agent who gets it—who understands communication, who respects client time, who operates with transparency about fees and services—Santa Clarita Open Houses is built for exactly that.

## Q&amp;A: Common Questions About Real Estate Agent Communication

**Q: Is it normal for an agent to be unavailable during the day?** A: It can be. If they're in showings or working with other clients, that's understandable. But they should have a clear communication plan for how quickly they'll return messages. If it regularly takes 24-48 hours to get a response, that's a problem.

**Q: What should I do if my agent isn't communicating?** A: Address it immediately. Send a direct email: "I've noticed response times have been slow. Can we establish a protocol where I hear back within X hours?" If they don't adjust, you likely need a new agent.

**Q: Are flat fee agents less responsive than commission agents?** A: Not necessarily. Some flat fee agents are excellent communicators. The fee structure doesn't determine communication quality—the agent's character does. But make sure you understand what you're getting for the flat fee before signing.

**Q: Can I ask an agent about their communication style in an interview?** A: Absolutely. This is a critical question. A confident, professional agent will welcome it and give you specifics about their process.

**Q: What if my agent and I have different communication preferences?** A: Work it out before you start. Some people prefer phone calls, others prefer text. Some want daily updates, others want weekly. Clarify this upfront.

**Q: How important is the buyer broker agreement?** A: Very. It's a legal document that defines your relationship with the agent. Never sign without understanding it completely. Ask for explanations on any parts you don't understand.

## Summary

Agent communication isn't a luxury—it's a baseline requirement. When you're choosing a real estate agent in Santa Clarita Valley, the time to establish communication expectations is before you sign, not after problems emerge. Ask about response times, availability, communication style, and fee structures. Understand the buyer broker agreement and what services you're actually getting. When you work through a vetted referral network like Santa Clarita Open Houses, you're getting agents who have already proven they meet these standards. You're not rolling the dice. You're working with professionals who understand that communication, transparency, and accountability matter.
