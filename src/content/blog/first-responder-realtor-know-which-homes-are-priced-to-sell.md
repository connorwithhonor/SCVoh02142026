### Know Which Homes Are Priced to Sell: The First Responder Realtor’s Insight

**Connor with Honor | First Responder Realtor**

**Santa Clarita Valley Real Estate Market | October 13th, 2024**

As a **First Responder Realtor**, my goal is not just to help you buy or sell a home, but to protect you throughout the entire process. My experience in law enforcement has given me a unique perspective on trust, strategy, and precision, which I bring to every real estate transaction. Today’s market update and insights will help you navigate the current Santa Clarita Valley real estate scene with confidence.

If you’re looking for the best homes—those priced right and ready to sell—this post is for you. I’ll break down the key numbers, give you insights into the cities within the Santa Clarita Valley, and explain how my background allows me to offer a uniquely effective approach to real estate.

### Market Snapshot – Santa Clarita Valley

Let’s start with the numbers from the **last 7 days**:

### Total Active Listings

As of **October 13th, 2024**, there are **551 active residential listings** across the Santa Clarita Valley. This includes single-family residences, condos, and townhomes in cities like **Castaic**, **Canyon Country**, **Newhall**, **Saugus**, **Stevenson Ranch**, and **Valencia**.

The uptick in inventory is noteworthy. A week ago, we were hovering around 540 listings, and the slight increase in homes for sale means buyers are seeing more options. However, we are still in a market where demand remains strong, and competition can be fierce.

### Insights by City: Where Are the Best Deals?

#### **Valencia**

Valencia remains a top destination for families and buyers looking for a blend of suburban charm and modern convenience. A standout listing in Valencia this week is a **5-bedroom home in Monte Verde**, priced at **$1.075 million**. It’s in a family-friendly neighborhood with excellent schools, parks, and access to shopping and dining. Valencia homes tend to sell quickly due to the desirability of the area and its reputation for quality living.

**What Buyers Need to Know**: In Valencia, homes priced right in good school districts move fast. If you’re interested, be prepared to act quickly and make strong offers to stand out.

#### **Canyon Country**

Canyon Country has become increasingly attractive due to its competitive pricing and spacious properties. One listing that has caught my eye is a **2,364 sq. ft. home in Mountain Shadows**, listed at **$799,900**. Buyers who prioritize space and outdoor living will find this to be a solid deal. Homes in this price range in Canyon Country often offer more square footage than comparably priced homes in other Santa Clarita cities.

**What Buyers Need to Know**: Canyon Country is ideal for buyers looking for more bang for their buck. Larger homes with outdoor areas at a competitive price point are the norm here.

#### **Saugus**

Saugus continues to hold strong with great listings, particularly in neighborhoods like **Mountain View Homes**. A home in this area, priced around **$900,000**, offers the advantage of larger lots and more privacy compared to other areas. Saugus is known for its charm, community feel, and relatively lower density compared to more developed areas like Valencia.

**What Buyers Need to Know**: If you’re looking for larger lots and homes with room to breathe, Saugus is a great choice. Expect homes here to appeal to buyers who want space without sacrificing convenience.

#### **Stevenson Ranch**

For those interested in luxury properties, **Stevenson Ranch** has a **5-bedroom listing in Old Orchard**, priced at **$1.299 million**. Known for its premium amenities and larger lot sizes, Stevenson Ranch offers beautiful views, high-end finishes, and a peaceful lifestyle. Buyers in this market are often looking for homes that offer both quality construction and privacy.

**What Buyers Need to Know**: Stevenson Ranch is for discerning buyers who are looking for premium features, such as expansive views and larger homes on bigger lots. Expect to pay more, but you’ll be rewarded with some of the best living conditions in the Valley.
