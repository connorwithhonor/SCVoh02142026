### Know Which Homes Are Priced to Sell: The First Responder Realtor’s Insight

**Connor with Honor | First Responder Realtor**

**Santa Clarita Valley Real Estate Market | October 13th, 2024**

As a **First Responder Realtor**, my goal is not just to help you buy or sell a home, but to protect you throughout the entire process. My experience in law enforcement has given me a unique perspective on trust, strategy, and precision, which I bring to every real estate transaction. Today’s market update and insights will help you navigate the current Santa Clarita Valley real estate scene with confidence.

If you’re looking for the best homes—those priced right and ready to sell—this post is for you. I’ll break down the key numbers, give you insights into the cities within the Santa Clarita Valley, and explain how my background allows me to offer a uniquely effective approach to real estate.

### Market Snapshot – Santa Clarita Valley

Let’s start with the numbers from the **last 7 days**:

	- 
	**Coming Soon**: 11 properties are expected to hit the market soon. These listings represent opportunities for buyers who want to be ahead of the curve and gain first-mover advantage.

	

	- 
	**New Listings**: 77 homes have been freshly listed. This indicates a steady stream of inventory, giving buyers a variety of options and sellers healthy competition.

	

	- 
	**Price Changes**: 65 properties have adjusted their prices. This suggests that some homes may have been initially overpriced, prompting a reduction. For buyers, this is an opportunity to find deals.

	

	- 
	**Back on Market**: 28 properties returned to the market after previous offers fell through. Whether due to financing or inspection issues, these homes represent potential opportunities for persistent buyers.

	

	- 
	**Active Under Contract**: 28 homes are currently under contract. This shows strong buyer activity, but these deals aren’t finalized yet—sometimes offers fall through, and savvy buyers can still step in.

	

	- 
	**Pending**: 44 homes are in the final stages of the transaction process. These represent solid indicators of where the market is headed in terms of sales.

	

	- 
	**Closed Sales**: 60 homes have successfully sold in the past week, a positive indicator of healthy market movement.

	

	- 
	**Expired Listings**: 5 listings expired, which may indicate that those properties were either overpriced or the sellers did not adjust to market conditions.

	

	- 
	**Canceled Listings**: 15 listings were removed from the market, often due to sellers reassessing their plans or market conditions.

	

	- 
	**Hold**: 11 properties are temporarily off the market but may come back. This often happens when sellers need more time or are waiting for a strategic time to re-enter the market.

	

	- 
	**Withdrawn**: 3 homes were fully withdrawn from the market. These are properties that likely won’t be coming back any time soon.

	

### Total Active Listings

As of **October 13th, 2024**, there are **551 active residential listings** across the Santa Clarita Valley. This includes single-family residences, condos, and townhomes in cities like **Castaic**, **Canyon Country**, **Newhall**, **Saugus**, **Stevenson Ranch**, and **Valencia**.

The uptick in inventory is noteworthy. A week ago, we were hovering around 540 listings, and the slight increase in homes for sale means buyers are seeing more options. However, we are still in a market where demand remains strong, and competition can be fierce.

### Insights by City: Where Are the Best Deals?

#### **Valencia**

Valencia remains a top destination for families and buyers looking for a blend of suburban charm and modern convenience. A standout listing in Valencia this week is a **5-bedroom home in Monte Verde**, priced at **$1.075 million**. It’s in a family-friendly neighborhood with excellent schools, parks, and access to shopping and dining. Valencia homes tend to sell quickly due to the desirability of the area and its reputation for quality living.

**What Buyers Need to Know**: In Valencia, homes priced right in good school districts move fast. If you’re interested, be prepared to act quickly and make strong offers to stand out.

#### **Canyon Country**

Canyon Country has become increasingly attractive due to its competitive pricing and spacious properties. One listing that has caught my eye is a **2,364 sq. ft. home in Mountain Shadows**, listed at **$799,900**. Buyers who prioritize space and outdoor living will find this to be a solid deal. Homes in this price range in Canyon Country often offer more square footage than comparably priced homes in other Santa Clarita cities.

**What Buyers Need to Know**: Canyon Country is ideal for buyers looking for more bang for their buck. Larger homes with outdoor areas at a competitive price point are the norm here.

#### **Saugus**

Saugus continues to hold strong with great listings, particularly in neighborhoods like **Mountain View Homes**. A home in this area, priced around **$900,000**, offers the advantage of larger lots and more privacy compared to other areas. Saugus is known for its charm, community feel, and relatively lower density compared to more developed areas like Valencia.

**What Buyers Need to Know**: If you’re looking for larger lots and homes with room to breathe, Saugus is a great choice. Expect homes here to appeal to buyers who want space without sacrificing convenience.

#### **Stevenson Ranch**

For those interested in luxury properties, **Stevenson Ranch** has a **5-bedroom listing in Old Orchard**, priced at **$1.299 million**. Known for its premium amenities and larger lot sizes, Stevenson Ranch offers beautiful views, high-end finishes, and a peaceful lifestyle. Buyers in this market are often looking for homes that offer both quality construction and privacy.

**What Buyers Need to Know**: Stevenson Ranch is for discerning buyers who are looking for premium features, such as expansive views and larger homes on bigger lots. Expect to pay more, but you’ll be rewarded with some of the best living conditions in the Valley.

### Why My Approach Is Different: First Responder Experience Applied to Real Estate

You might be wondering, how does my experience as a first responder translate to real estate? Here’s how:

	- 
	**Vigilance and Attention to Detail**

	As a former first responder, vigilance is second nature. I pay close attention to the details that matter most in real estate transactions—whether it’s thoroughly reviewing contracts, inspecting properties for potential issues, or analyzing market data. Just like in law enforcement, small details can make or break a situation. In real estate, those same details can lead to big financial wins or costly mistakes.

	

	- 
	**Strategic Thinking and Crisis Management**

	In my former career, managing crises was a daily responsibility. This ability to think quickly and strategically under pressure serves my clients well in negotiations, handling unexpected hurdles, and managing the complexities of real estate transactions. Whether it's a sudden market shift or a buyer backing out, I remain calm, collected, and ready with a solution.

	

	- 
	**Protecting Your Interests**

	My number one priority, just like it was when I served as a first responder, is to protect my clients. In real estate, that means guiding you through the process so that your financial and personal interests are secure. Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, I take pride in ensuring you’re not just a transaction but a valued client whose future is protected.

	

	- 
	**Trust and Integrity**

	Trust is built through actions, not words. My time as a first responder was built on trust with the community, and I bring that same trustworthiness into every real estate transaction. You can count on me to act in your best interest, providing honest, transparent advice.

	

### Santa Clarita Market Dynamics: A Look at the Future

Looking at the data from the last seven days, it’s clear that the Santa Clarita Valley market remains active. However, as we move toward the end of 2024, we could see shifts based on external factors like interest rates and buyer demand. Here’s what to keep an eye on:

	- 
	**Interest Rates**

	Interest rates have been a key factor driving buyer behavior in 2024. If rates remain stable, we’ll likely continue to see strong buyer demand. However, if they drop, we could see an even greater surge of activity, leading to increased competition and rising home prices.

	

	- 
	**Inventory Levels**

	Inventory is slowly creeping up, but we haven’t reached the levels necessary for a significant market shift. If inventory climbs into the **700-800 range**, we may see a shift toward a buyer’s market. But for now, sellers still have the upper hand, especially if homes are priced strategically.

	

	- 
	**Buyer Psychology**

	As we head into the final months of the year, buyer psychology will play a big role in determining how the market behaves. Are buyers willing to push their budgets in the face of limited inventory? Will sellers hold firm on their asking prices, or will we see more price adjustments?

	

### Why It Matters

The Santa Clarita Valley is a unique real estate market, with its mix of suburban charm, family-friendly neighborhoods, and high-end luxury properties. Whether you’re buying or selling, understanding the dynamics of this market is crucial. With the right guidance, you can make informed decisions that protect your financial interests and set you up for long-term success.
