## TL;DR

The Santa Clarita real estate market in mid-June 2025 is active and nuanced, with inventory levels fluctuating around 173 active listings. Those much-discussed price reductions you're seeing are not a sign of a market collapse; rather, they are strategic adjustments from ambitious initial asking prices, with final sale prices continuing their upward trend since January. For buyers, this creates opportunities to negotiate, while sellers must focus on impeccable marketing—especially 3D virtual tours—to stand out. Understanding the market's true drivers, like "Coming Soon" listings and the real factors behind mortgage rates, is essential for making your next move with confidence and honor.

### Decoding the Santa Clarita Real Estate Market: A June 19, 2025 Update

Hey everyone, it's Connor MacIvor, your First Responder Realtor®, coming to you with some crucial real estate recon for Santa Clarita. As we navigate the middle of 2025, the market is buzzing with activity, questions, and a fair bit of misinformation. My mission here at [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/) is to cut through that noise and give you the ground truth, whether you're thinking of buying or selling in this incredible valley.

Today, we're going to dive deep into what's really happening with local inventory, dissect the truth behind those "price change" alerts that cause so much panic, and lay out actionable strategies for both buyers and sellers. Let's get into it.

### The Truth About Price Changes in the SCV: Don't Believe the Hype

One of the biggest topics of conversation I hear about from clients and see online revolves around price changes. Many people see a "Price Reduced" banner and immediately think it's a signal of impending doom for the market. I'm here to tell you that, based on the data, that's simply not the case.

These price changes haven't negatively impacted the actual closed sale prices in the Santa Clarita Valley over the last several months. In fact, the data shows that sale prices have been on a steady incline since January. So, what are these reductions you're seeing?

It's the difference between a seller's initial ambition and what discerning buyers are willing to entertain. Think of it this way: a homeowner sees that the last comparable home in their neighborhood sold for $870,000. In an effort to maximize their return, they decide to list their home for $900,000, hoping to capture the market's upward momentum. After a couple of weeks with limited activity, they reduce the price to a more competitive $885,000.

Is this a market crash? Absolutely not. The property is still priced $15,000 *above* the last sold comparable. What you're witnessing is not a dip below the established market value, but a strategic reduction from an optimistic list price to a different, more realistic list price. We are even seeing some sellers increase their prices in the last week, which tells you the market is anything but waning. To truly understand a neighborhood's value, you need to look at the hard data on sold properties, not just the fluctuating asking prices. You can explore detailed trends for specific communities on our [Valencia Market Report](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/valencia-market-report) or by requesting a [Free Market Analysis](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/free-market-analysis) for your own home.

### A Snapshot of Santa Clarita's Current Housing Inventory

As of today, June 19, 2025, the Santa Clarita Valley is seeing a dynamic but manageable level of inventory.

	- **Total Active Listings:** We currently have 771**&nbsp;total active listings** across the SCV. This number is fluid; just yesterday it was at 168. This slight increase shows that more sellers are feeling confident about entering the market. You can view all of them on our [Active Listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings) page.

	- **Coming Soon Properties:** There are approximately **20 properties** in "Coming Soon" status. These are homes you won't find on the big portal sites yet, and we'll discuss why that's a massive advantage for you shortly.

For buyers, this inventory level means more choices than you might have had six months ago, but it's still a competitive environment. For sellers, it underscores the absolute necessity of making your property stand out from the competition. Whether you're looking in [Castaic](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/castaic-homes), [Saugus](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/saugus-homes), or [Canyon Country](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/canyon-country-homes), understanding the specific inventory in your target area is key. Our [Search By Area](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/search-by-area) tool is perfect for this.

### The "Coming Soon" Advantage: Your Secret Weapon in the Home Search

Let's talk about those 20 "Coming Soon" properties. In the real estate world, "Coming Soon" is a status that allows a listing agent to market a property for up to 21 days *before* it's officially available for showings. During this period, the listing is visible to every agent in the local Multiple Listing Service (MLS), but it is *not* syndicated to the major national websites like Zillow or Redfin.

What does this mean for you? It's a golden opportunity. The only people who see these homes are the buyers whose agents are actively looking for them on the MLS. This is your chance to get ahead of the crowd. By working with a dedicated local agent, you get access to this "pre-market" inventory before the general public even knows it exists. It gives you time to review the property, get your finances in order, and prepare a strong offer the moment it goes active.

I've made it easy for my clients. I can set you up with a direct feed of these listings. If you want to see what's coming, visit our page dedicated to [Coming Soon Listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/coming-soon-listings-see-the-homes-for-sale-before-zillow-and-redfin-get-them) and let me know your price range and desired area. I'll send you everything that matches, giving you a critical head start.

### Strategic Moves for Santa Clarita Home Buyers in 2025

The current market requires a smart, proactive approach. Here’s how to navigate it successfully:

	- 
	**Don't Be Afraid to Make the Offer:** As we discussed, many homes are priced optimistically. If you see a home you love but the price seems high, don't just dismiss it. Do your research on the latest sold properties—which you can do right here using our [Advanced Search](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/advanced-search)—and submit an offer that you can justify with data. With more properties on the market, some sellers will be more open to negotiation. You might be surprised at the outcome.

	

	- 
	**The Ease of Modern Offers:** The days of cumbersome paperwork are over. With digital signatures via platforms like DocuSign, writing an offer is incredibly simple and fast. If an agent ever makes you feel like you're wasting their time by wanting to write an offer, it's time to find another agent. You are the boss. My job is to execute your instructions efficiently and effectively.

	

	- 
	**Get Fully Pre-Approved:** In this market, a pre-qualification letter isn't enough. You need to be fully pre-approved, meaning a lender has thoroughly reviewed your finances and is ready to fund your loan. This shows sellers you're a serious, credible buyer. Start the process now on our [Get Pre-Approved](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/get-pre-approved) page.

	

	- 
	**Understand the "On Hold" Status:** Sometimes you'll see a great new listing, get excited to see it, and then it suddenly disappears. It may have been moved to an "On Hold" status. This isn't a cancellation. Often, it's because the seller has been overwhelmed with a flurry of offers and needs time to review them. It could also mean the seller needs a few extra days to prepare for the move. Don't write it off. Have your agent stay in close contact with the listing agent. More often than not, the property will come back on the market, and you'll be in a prime position to act.

### Winning Strategies for Santa Clarita Home Sellers in 2025

For sellers, standing out is the name of the game. Here's how to ensure your property commands top dollar and captures the attention of serious buyers.

	- 
	**The 3D Virtual Tour is Non-Negotiable:** I cannot stress this enough. In 2025, a high-quality 3D virtual tour (like those from Matterport) is an absolute necessity. It's not just a feature; it's a fundamental marketing tool. It acts as a 24/7 open house, allowing potential buyers from across town or across the world to virtually walk through your home, look up at the ceilings, and get a true sense of the space and layout. This is crucial. It pre-qualifies buyers, meaning the people who schedule in-person showings are already highly interested. I provide this service for every single one of my listings, from a $500,000 condo to a multi-million dollar estate.

	

	- 
	**Aerial Drone Photography: When It Makes Sense:** While 3D tours are universal, drone photography is more strategic. If your home is a standard tract home without a particularly notable lot or view, drone shots aren't essential. However, if your property has a spectacular view, backs up to open space, has a unique lot, or features amenities like a pool and beautiful landscaping, then aerial photos and videos are incredibly powerful. They showcase the property in a way that ground-level photos simply can't.

	

	- 
	**Price It Right From the Start:** While you want to maximize your profit, overpricing your home from day one can be a costly mistake. Homes that sit on the market for too long can develop a stigma. Buyers begin to wonder, "What's wrong with it?" It's far more effective to price it competitively from the beginning to generate a surge of initial interest, which can often lead to multiple offers. Use our [Free Market Analysis](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/free-market-analysis) tool to get a data-driven understanding of your home's value before you list. Our comprehensive [Seller's Guide](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/sellers-guide) can walk you through every step of the process.

	

### Mortgage Intelligence: Look Beyond the Fed's Headlines

There's a common misconception that the Federal Reserve directly sets mortgage rates. When the Fed adjusts the federal funds rate, it's adjusting the rate at which banks lend money to each other overnight. While this has an indirect trickle-down effect, it's not the primary driver of the 30-year fixed mortgage rates that most buyers use.

The real indicator to watch is the **10-year Treasury bond yield**. Mortgage rates track very closely with this bond. When investor confidence in the economy is high, they sell bonds, which pushes the yield up, and mortgage rates tend to follow. When there's economic uncertainty, investors flock to the safety of bonds, which drives the yield down, and mortgage rates often fall as well. So, if you want to know where rates are likely headed, pay more attention to the bond market than the Fed's press conferences. For the latest on financing, visit our [Mortgage Rates](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/mortgage-rates) page.

I hope this deep dive has been helpful. The Santa Clarita market is full of opportunity, and with the right information and the right guide, you can achieve your real estate goals. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm Connor, and I'm here to help.

## Key Takeaways

	- **Price Reductions Aren't a Crash:** Current price drops are adjustments from high initial asking prices, not a sign of falling market values. Actual sold prices in Santa Clarita have been rising since January 2025.

	- **Inventory is Active:** With around 173 active listings, the market offers more choice, but remains competitive. Sellers must prioritize making their homes stand out.

	- **3D Tours are Essential:** For sellers, a high-quality 3D virtual tour is a non-negotiable marketing tool that qualifies serious buyers and expands your reach.

	- **Leverage "Coming Soon" Listings:** Work with a local agent to access pre-market listings for up to 21 days before they hit major websites like Zillow, giving you a significant competitive advantage.

	- **Be a Proactive Buyer:** Get fully pre-approved for a loan, don't be afraid to write data-backed offers on seemingly overpriced homes, and understand that an "On Hold" status often means an opportunity is still in play.

	- **Watch the Right Financial Indicators:** Mortgage rates are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury bond yield than the Federal Reserve's announced rate changes.

	- **Local Expertise is Key:** A dedicated local real estate professional provides access to more accurate, timely data and has a nuanced understanding of Santa Clarita's unique neighborhoods compared to national portals.
