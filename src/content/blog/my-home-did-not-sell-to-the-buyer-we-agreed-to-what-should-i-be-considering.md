When navigating the real estate market in Valencia, CA, you'll inevitably encounter properties labeled as&nbsp;**Back on Market (BOM)**. This term refers to listings that were under contract but, for various reasons, have returned to active status. Understanding the implications of a back-on-market property can help both buyers and sellers make informed decisions in an ever-evolving real estate market.

In this comprehensive guide, I’ll break down the meaning of BOM properties, the reasons deals fall apart, and the strategies you can use as a buyer or seller to navigate these situations effectively. By the end, you'll know how to handle back-on-market situations like a seasoned pro.

### What Does "Back on Market" Mean?

Simply put, a property is considered&nbsp;**Back on Market**&nbsp;when a purchase agreement has fallen through. The home, once marked as "under contract" or "in escrow," becomes available to new buyers again. BOM properties account for 20-30% of listings in Valencia, CA, and the surrounding Santa Clarita Valley—so it’s not an uncommon occurrence.

But why does this happen? Let’s explore the key reasons.

### Common Reasons Properties Return to Market

	- 
	**Financing Issues**

	
		**Buyer Credit Changes**: Sometimes, buyers make large purchases (e.g., a car) while in escrow, inadvertently lowering their credit score and losing loan approval.

		- **Unexpected Debt or Loss of Income**: A sudden financial hardship can disqualify buyers from securing financing.

		- **Lender Delays**: Inadequate vetting or slow processing from lenders can derail deals.

	

	
	- 
	**Buyer’s Remorse**

	
		Some buyers get cold feet, deciding the property or the price no longer aligns with their goals. This often shows up during inspection or appraisal phases.

	

	
	- 
	**Inspection and Repair Negotiations**

	
		Issues uncovered during the home inspection—like faulty wiring or plumbing—can lead to disputes over repair costs.

		- Unrealistic repair demands from buyers can frustrate sellers, causing the deal to fall apart.

	

	
	- 
	**Appraisal Challenges**

	
		If the home appraises for less than the agreed-upon price, buyers may need to renegotiate, or sellers may refuse to lower the price.

	

	
	- 
	**Life Events**

	
		Buyers or sellers may face unexpected life changes, such as job loss, divorce, or illness, which force them to walk away from the deal.

	

	
	- 
	**Dual Agency Conflicts**

	
		When one agent represents both the buyer and seller, conflicts of interest can arise, complicating negotiations and causing misunderstandings.

	

	

### Impact of Back-on-Market Properties on Sellers

For sellers, having a property return to the market can be disheartening. However, it’s not always the doom-and-gloom scenario it appears to be.

#### **Perception of the Property**

	- Buyers may wonder if something is wrong with the home.

	- It’s critical to communicate clearly about why the deal fell through—especially if the issues were buyer-related and not the property itself.

#### **Time on Market**

	- Longer market exposure can weaken a home’s appeal. In Valencia's competitive real estate market, fresh listings typically attract more attention than ones that have lingered.

#### **Adjusting Strategy**

	- Sellers should work closely with their agents to refine pricing, address any inspection-related issues, and vet future offers thoroughly.

### Strategies for Sellers to Avoid BOM Situations

	- 
	**Pre-Sale Preparation**

	
		Conduct a pre-listing inspection to identify and address potential issues before listing.

		- Price the home competitively based on recent comparable sales in Valencia, CA.

	

	
	- 
	**Thorough Offer Vetting**

	
		Ensure that all offers come with pre-approval letters, not just pre-qualification.

		- Verify that buyers have stable finances and no red flags in their credit history.

	

	
	- 
	**Negotiation Clarity**

	
		Use clear terms in counteroffers. For example, specify that the home is sold "as-is" to minimize future disputes.

		- Consider including timelines for inspections and repair requests to keep the process moving smoothly.

	

	
	- 
	**Professional Representation**

	
		Choose an experienced agent who can advocate for your interests without succumbing to emotional reactions.

	

	

### Tips for Buyers Considering BOM Properties

From a buyer's perspective, BOM listings can offer unique opportunities, but they also require extra scrutiny.

	- 
	**Ask Questions**

	
		Why did the property fall out of escrow? Understanding the backstory can help you assess whether the issue was property-related or simply a buyer problem.

	

	
	- 
	**Get a Detailed Inspection**

	
		Even if the previous buyer’s inspection uncovered no major issues, conducting your own inspection ensures you’re making an informed decision.

	

	
	- 
	**Negotiate Smartly**

	
		BOM properties often signal motivated sellers. Use this to your advantage during price negotiations.

	

	
	- 
	**Secure Financing Early**

	
		Make sure your financial situation is rock-solid before submitting an offer to avoid contributing to the BOM statistics.

	

	

### Dual Agency and Its Pitfalls

In Valencia’s real estate market, dual agency—where one agent represents both the buyer and seller—can complicate transactions. While it’s legal in California, it’s a scenario fraught with potential conflicts of interest. For BOM situations, having separate representation can provide clarity and ensure both parties’ interests are fully protected.

### Back-on-Market Statistics in Valencia, CA

In recent months, BOM properties in Valencia have averaged:

	- **20-30% of Listings**: This underscores the importance of thorough offer evaluations and contingency planning.

	- **Price Reductions of 3-5%**: Motivated sellers often adjust pricing to regain buyer interest.

	- **Average Time to Resell**: About two weeks longer than newly listed properties, due to additional vetting by cautious buyers.

### Avoiding Emotional Decision-Making

Real estate transactions can be emotionally charged, especially when deals fall apart. However, emotions often cloud judgment and hinder effective decision-making. Whether you’re a buyer or seller, it’s essential to remain objective and rely on experienced professionals to guide you.

### Conclusion: Turning Challenges into Opportunities

Back-on-market properties don’t have to spell disaster. For sellers, they offer a chance to reevaluate strategies and reengage the market with renewed vigor. For buyers, they present opportunities to secure a home in a competitive area like Valencia, CA.

Whether you’re dealing with a BOM situation as a buyer or seller, having the right agent by your side makes all the difference. An agent who understands the nuances of Valencia’s real estate market can help you navigate these challenges and come out on top.
