# Artificial Intelligence - Truth - Humanize Santa Clarita Daily

AI - Artificial Intelligence maybe the next great step, like the agricultural and industrial revolutions. I'm sure there were some bumps and bruises obtained (and a lot of "life ending" tragedies) as a result of those change-overs.

Truth in the building of Artificial Intelligence is one of the tenants as to how we don't lose who we are and potentially do something so "self serving" the world ends in a wimper.&nbsp;

Truth - ensure what you are reading online is truth. Fact check and verify. I used to be able to tell the differences between photographs of real people versus of AI generated people. Now, they have won that, where if I'm looking at something online designed by AI, if I did not know that, I would have not have figured out. Those images are more real than actual images and they adhere themselves to our biases. Video, that's here now. Cannot tell real from fake on Video. After the two major methods are trumped by Artificial intelligence, we will really need to be on our guard. And those companies who will be started because of a need to prove or disprove some information, a photograph, a video or sound bite, online, they will become very popular, until they start being faked.&nbsp;

This will only be able to be handled by imposing rules. I know you hate that, we all hate rules. But when some of the hardest cons in supermax prisons are asked about what was lacking in their youth, they all said parental discipline.&nbsp;

We need rules - religions - whether true or not or some variation there of, they impose rules. Some say it's convienent to keep us humans "In line", some say it's the biggest money making scheme ever, and others don't just believe, like me, I know that God exists and is in my life and I, as a result have rules. I break some, I'm not proud of that, but there are there constantly letting me know when I have lied to myself. In order to move on and not get stuck on repeat with lying to ones self, you have to love yourself and forgive yourself. If you can do that, you will never be fat again, you will get rid of all your addictions and if you really do that, you will be totally free and accept everything now.

And I have been reading and self discovering, thanks to being concerned. Here is the Santa Clarita real estate daily show.

Hey Santa Clarita Valley, Connor with Honor here, your trusted Santa Clarita Realtor. Today, we're diving deep into the latest real estate trends and how they're shaping our local market. We'll also take a peek at some interesting insights from recent sales in Valencia. So, let's get started!

**Market Watch**

First up, let's take a quick look at our 7-day snapshot. We've got a bustling market with 57 new listings hitting the scene, and 26 homes already under contract. That tells us buyers are out there and ready to make moves. We've also seen 74 price changes, which is a reminder that pricing your home right is crucial in this market.

**Valencia Deep Dive**

Now, let's zoom in on Valencia. I've been analyzing the past 90 days of sold single-family homes, and here's what's caught my eye:

	- **Northbridge is King:** When it comes to price per square foot, Northbridge reigns supreme with an average of $542. That's a premium location, folks!

	- **Quick Sales in West Creek:** If you're looking for a fast sale, Valencia West Creek is the place to be. Homes there are flying off the market with an average of just 7 days on market.

	- **Concessions Still Happening:** We're still seeing seller concessions in Valencia, with the most common being a 2.5% credit towards buyer's closing costs.

**Headline News &amp; Santa Clarita**

Now, let's turn our attention to the national stage and see how the latest headlines could impact us here in the Santa Clarita Valley.

	- **Headline 1: Interest Rates on the Rise Again**

	
		How this affects SCV: This could put a damper on buyer enthusiasm, especially for first-time buyers. We might see a slight slowdown in the market, but well-priced homes in desirable neighborhoods will still attract strong interest.

	

	
	- **Headline 2: Inventory Shortage Continues**
	
		How this affects SCV: This is good news for sellers! Low inventory means less competition and potentially higher sale prices. If you're thinking of selling, now could be a great time.

	

	
	- **Headline 3: Remote Work Trend Solidifies**
	
		How this affects SCV: This is a huge opportunity for our valley. With more people working from home, they're looking for spacious homes with great amenities. Santa Clarita's family-friendly atmosphere and excellent schools make us a prime destination for these buyers.

### **Connor with Honor Real Estate Market Update | Day 271-2024**

**Intro:**

Hey everyone, it's Connor with Honor here, your trusted realtor in Santa Clarita Valley, and welcome to your daily real estate market update for day 271 of 2024. Today, we're breaking down the most important real estate headlines, how they impact our local market here in the Santa Clarita Valley, and what it all means for buyers and sellers alike. So if you're in the market, or just want to stay ahead of the trends, you're in the right place!

### **Top National and California Real Estate News**

	- 
	**Headline: "Fed's Rate Pause Creates More Buyer Competition"**

	
		**Impact on Santa Clarita Valley**: The Federal Reserve's decision to pause interest rate hikes has created a ripple effect in the housing market. Nationally, we've seen an increase in buyer competition as lower interest rates make homes slightly more affordable. Locally, we're feeling the pinch with inventory tightening. Our **Market Watch** shows only **531 active residential listings**, which includes SFRs, condos, and townhomes.

		- Buyers: Be ready for competitive offers, and possibly more properties selling over asking price.

		- Sellers: This is a prime time to list your home, as decreased inventory gives you the advantage of less competition and possibly faster sales at higher prices.

	

	
	- 
	**Headline: "Homebuilders Slow Down as Material Costs Surge Again"**

	
		**Impact on Santa Clarita Valley**: For those looking to buy a new construction home, rising costs of materials are making it more difficult for builders to meet demand. This slowdown is keeping the resale market hot, as buyers turn toward existing homes. If you're considering listing your home, this might be the right time since new builds are less of a threat to your potential sale.

	

	

### **Santa Clarita Market Watch | 7-Day Snapshot**

In the past week, we've seen some movement across the market:

	- **Coming Soon**: 10 new homes set to hit the market soon.

	- **New Listings**: 57 homes have been listed, adding to our inventory.

	- **Price Changes**: 74 price adjustments, which may signal motivated sellers.

	- **Back on Market**: 16 homes fell out of escrow and are now available again.

	- **Pending Sales**: 46 homes are currently in escrow.

	- **Closed Sales**: 61 homes sold in the last week.

	- **Total Active Inventory**: 531 homes, a decrease from previous weeks, signaling higher buyer competition.

### **90-Day Valencia Data | Key Insights from Sold Homes**

Diving deeper into Valencia's real estate data, I’ve reviewed the last 90 days of sales for single-family homes in the 91355 and 91354 zip codes. Here’s what you need to know:

	- **Price Per Square Foot (PPSF)**: The average price per square foot for homes in these areas ranges between **$330 - $400**, depending on the size, location, and features of the home.

	- **Days on Market (DOM/CDOM)**: On average, homes in Valencia spent **30-90 days on the market** before going under contract. The longer DOM tends to correlate with higher price points or homes needing more updates.

	- **Concessions**: Sellers have been offering concessions like **interest rate buy-downs** and **repair credits** to sweeten the deal for buyers. For example, one seller in **Aspen Meadow CT** (Listing ID: SR24083571) sold their home for **$830,000** after 92 days on the market and offered **2.5% BAC** to the buyer’s agent but gave no concessions.

	- **Faster Escrow Times**: Homes with **3 bedrooms** in prime areas of Valencia are entering escrow within **30 days** on average, with typical escrows lasting around **30-45 days**. Interestingly, homes with **repair requests** from buyers were more likely to have extended escrow times, often due to negotiation back-and-forth.

	- **Notable Sale**: A home on **River Trail Lane** (Listing ID: SR24138344) sold in just **one day** for **$850,000**, signaling that well-priced homes in desirable neighborhoods are moving fast.

### **Advice for Buyers and Sellers**

	- **For Buyers**: The data shows that homes are selling quickly, especially those that are well-priced. Be prepared to act fast and possibly go above the asking price to secure your dream home. Also, consider asking for seller concessions, like an interest rate buy-down, especially if you're stretching your budget.

	- **For Sellers**: The current market is in your favor, but don't get too comfortable. Even in this competitive landscape, price your home correctly and consider offering small concessions, like covering some closing costs, to close the deal faster.

The columns L/C Price, Price Per Square Foot, Beds, Baths, Sqft, Lot Size Area, Close Date, and MLS Area Major seem to be of interest for the required analysis. We need to convert the columns L/C Price, Price Per Square Foot, Sqft, Lot Size Area, and Close Date to correct datatypes for later calculations. We will extract number of bathrooms from Baths column. We will utilize MLS Area Major column to look for neighborhoods and provide insights on average sold price per square foot and days on market for each neighborhood. We will also provide some interesting insights on the overall data.

Python

# Remove '$' and ',' from `L/C Price` and `Price Per Square Foot` columns and convert these columns to numeric
df_real_estate['L/C Price'] = df_real_estate['L/C Price'].astype(str).str.replace(r'[$,]', '', regex=True)
df_real_estate['L/C Price'] = pd.to_numeric(df_real_estate['L/C Price'])

df_real_estate['Price Per Square Foot'] = df_real_estate['Price Per Square Foot'].astype(str).str.replace(r'[$,]', '', regex=True)
df_real_estate['Price Per Square Foot'] = pd.to_numeric(df_real_estate['Price Per Square Foot'])

# Remove '/A' and '/B' from `Sqft` column and convert it to numeric
df_real_estate['Sqft'] = df_real_estate['Sqft'].astype(str).str.replace('/[A,B]', '', regex=True)
df_real_estate['Sqft'] = pd.to_numeric(df_real_estate['Sqft'])

# Remove ',' from `Lot Size Area` column and convert it to numeric
df_real_estate['Lot Size Area'] = df_real_estate['Lot Size Area'].astype(str).str.replace(',', '', regex=False)
df_real_estate['Lot Size Area'] = pd.to_numeric(df_real_estate['Lot Size Area'], errors='coerce')

# Convert `Close Date` column to datetime format
df_real_estate['Close Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_real_estate['Close Date'], format='%m/%d/%y')

# Extract the second value after '/' from `Br/Ba` column, convert it to numeric and assign to new column `Baths`
df_real_estate['Baths'] = df_real_estate['Br/Ba'].astype(str).str.split('/').str[1]
df_real_estate['Baths'] = pd.to_numeric(df_real_estate['Baths'])

# Extract the first value before '/' from `DOM/CDOM` column, convert it to numeric and assign to new column `DOM`
df_real_estate['DOM'] = df_real_estate['DOM/CDOM'].astype(str).str.split('/').str[0]
df_real_estate['DOM'] = pd.to_numeric(df_real_estate['DOM'])

# Group the data on `MLS Area Major` column, take mean of `Price Per Square Foot` and `DOM` columns and assign to new dataframe `df_grouped`
df_grouped = df_real_estate.groupby('MLS Area Major')[['Price Per Square Foot', 'DOM']].mean().reset_index()

# Sort grouped dataframe in descending order of `Price Per Square Foot`
df_grouped = df_grouped.sort_values(by='Price Per Square Foot', ascending=False)

# Display summary statistics of numerical columns and first 5 rows of `df_real_estate`
print("\nSummary Statistics:\n")
print(df_real_estate.describe().to_markdown(numalign="left", stralign="left"))
print("\nFirst 5 rows:\n")
print(df_real_estate.head().to_markdown(index=False, numalign="left", stralign="left"))

# Display the first 5 rows of `df_grouped`
print("\nGrouped Data:\n")
print(df_grouped.head().to_markdown(index=False, numalign="left", stralign="left"))

Code output

Traceback (most recent call last):

ValueError: Unable to parse string "1721/SEE"

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

ValueError: Unable to parse string "1721/SEE" at position 10

Use code [with caution.](/faq#coding)

It appears that the Sqft column contains non-numeric value such as '1721/SEE' that cannot be converted to numeric. We need to remove all non-numeric characters from Sqft column before converting to numeric. We will then proceed with the remaining analysis as planned earlier.

Python

# Remove all non-numeric characters (keep only digits) from `Sqft` column and convert it to numeric
df_real_estate['Sqft'] = df_real_estate['Sqft'].astype(str).str.replace(r'\D', '', regex=True)
df_real_estate['Sqft'] = pd.to_numeric(df_real_estate['Sqft'], errors='coerce')

# Group the data on `MLS Area Major` column, take mean of `Price Per Square Foot` and `DOM` columns and assign to new dataframe `df_grouped`
df_grouped = df_real_estate.groupby('MLS Area Major')[['Price Per Square Foot', 'DOM']].mean().reset_index()

# Sort grouped dataframe in descending order of `Price Per Square Foot`
df_grouped = df_grouped.sort_values(by='Price Per Square Foot', ascending=False)

# Display summary statistics of numerical columns and first 5 rows of `df_real_estate`

print(df_real_estate.describe().to_markdown(numalign="left", stralign="left"))

print(df_real_estate.head().to_markdown(index=False, numalign="left", stralign="left"))

# Display the first 5 rows of `df_grouped`
print("\nGrouped Data:\n")

  File "grouper.py", line 888, in get_grouper
    raise KeyError(gpr)
KeyError: 'MLS Area Major'

Use code [with caution.](/faq#coding)

It seems that the MLS Area Major column does not exist. We need to print the column names to make sure we got the column name right.

Python

# Print the column names of `df_real_estate`
print(df_real_estate.columns)

Code output

Index(['Unnamed: 0', 'Listing ID', 'S', 'Sub Type', 'St#', 'St Name', 'City',
       'Area', 'SLC', 'L/C Price', 'Price Per Square Foot', 'Br/Ba', 'Sqft',
       'Yr Built', 'LSqft/Ac', 'DOM/CDOM', 'V', 'PP', 'BAC',
       'Contract Status Change Date', 'MLS'],
      dtype='object')

Use code [with caution.](/faq#coding)

The column that corresponds to MLS Area Major is actually called Area in the df_real_estate dataframe. We need to group the data on Area column, take mean of Price Per Square Foot and DOM columns and assign to new dataframe df_grouped. We will then proceed with the remaining analysis as planned earlier.

Python

# Group the data on `Area` column, take mean of `Price Per Square Foot` and `DOM` columns and assign to new dataframe `df_grouped`
df_grouped = df_real_estate.groupby('Area')[['Price Per Square Foot', 'DOM']].mean().reset_index()

# Sort grouped dataframe in descending order of `Price Per Square Foot`
df_grouped = df_grouped.sort_values(by='Price Per Square Foot', ascending=False)

# Display summary statistics of numerical columns and first 5 rows of `df_real_estate`
print("\nSummary Statistics:\n")
print(df_real_estate.describe().to_markdown(numalign="left", stralign="left"))

    raise KeyError(f"Columns not found: {str(bad_keys)[1:-1]}")
KeyError: "Columns not found: 'DOM'"

Use code [with caution.](/faq#coding)

It seems that the DOM column does not exist in the df_real_estate dataframe. We need to print the column names to make sure we got the column name right.

Python

# Print the column names of `df_real_estate`
print(df_real_estate.columns)

Code output

Index(['Unnamed: 0', 'Listing ID', 'S', 'Sub Type', 'St#', 'St Name', 'City',

       'Yr Built', 'LSqft/Ac', 'DOM/CDOM', 'V', 'PP', 'BAC',
       'Contract Status Change Date', 'MLS'],
      dtype='object')

Use code [with caution.](/faq#coding)

The column that corresponds to Days on Market is actually called DOM/CDOM in the df_real_estate dataframe. We need to extract the first value before '/' from DOM/CDOM column, convert it to numeric and assign to new column DOM. We will then proceed with the remaining analysis as planned earlier.

Python

# Extract the first value before '/' from `DOM/CDOM` column, convert it to numeric and assign to new column `DOM`
df_real_estate['DOM'] = df_real_estate['DOM/CDOM'].astype(str).str.split('/').str[0]
df_real_estate['DOM'] = pd.to_numeric(df_real_estate['DOM'], errors='coerce')

# Group the data on `Area` column, take mean of `Price Per Square Foot` and `DOM` columns and assign to new dataframe `df_grouped`
df_grouped = df_real_estate.groupby('Area')[['Price Per Square Foot', 'DOM']].mean().reset_index()

# Sort grouped dataframe in descending order of `Price Per Square Foot`
df_grouped = df_grouped.sort_values(by='Price Per Square Foot', ascending=False)

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
