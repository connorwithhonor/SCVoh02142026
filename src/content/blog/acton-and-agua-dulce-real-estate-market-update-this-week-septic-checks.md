The Santa Clarita Valley real estate market remains active, with steady updates that highlight both opportunities for buyers and strategic insights for sellers. Covering cities like **Acton**, **Agua Dulce**, **Canyon Country**, **Castaic**, **Newhall**, **Saugus**, **Stevenson Ranch**, and **Valencia**, this snapshot provides an overview of the most recent activity across these sought-after areas.

Let’s dive into each segment of the market update, exploring what these numbers mean for anyone interested in Santa Clarita Valley real estate.

#### **1. Coming Soon Properties: 8 New Listings**

Across Santa Clarita Valley, there are currently **8 properties listed as "Coming Soon"**. This status indicates homes that will be hitting the market shortly, creating a sense of anticipation for potential buyers. Buyers in Acton, Agua Dulce, and beyond can benefit from monitoring these properties, as coming-soon listings often provide a first look at highly desirable homes, potentially allowing for quicker action and less competition.

#### **2. New Listings: 58 Homes Recently Added to the Market**

In the past week, **58 new listings** have been added in Santa Clarita Valley, spanning the residential offerings in Canyon Country, Saugus, Valencia, and other areas. New listings provide fresh opportunities for buyers who are entering the market or who may have been waiting for the right home to appear. From single-family homes in Newhall to equestrian properties in Agua Dulce, the diverse range of new inventory ensures that there are options to fit various budgets and lifestyle needs.

#### **3. Price Changes: 72 Properties Adjust Their Prices**

There have been **72 price changes** in the last week, indicating that many sellers in cities like Castaic, Stevenson Ranch, and Valencia are adjusting their pricing strategies to align with buyer expectations. This trend can be particularly beneficial for buyers, who might find that previously out-of-budget homes are now within reach. For sellers, these price adjustments reflect the importance of staying competitive in a dynamic market, especially as we approach the winter season when buyer activity can slow down.

#### **4. Back on Market: 16 Properties Return for Sale**

In the past seven days, **16 properties have returned to the market** after falling out of escrow. This “Back on Market” status often provides renewed opportunities for buyers, especially those who may have missed a chance previously. Buyers in Santa Clarita neighborhoods like Valencia and Saugus should keep an eye on these properties, as they may offer insight into the initial pricing, inspection, or buyer financing conditions that led to their initial fall-through, providing an advantage when negotiating a new offer.

#### **5. Active Under Contract: 29 Homes in Escrow but Accepting Backup Offers**

With **29 properties currently under contract** but still accepting backup offers, buyers have an opportunity to submit secondary offers in case the primary deal falls through. This status is common in competitive markets like Stevenson Ranch and Valencia, where high demand can result in multiple offers on prime properties. Buyers interested in homes in these areas might consider submitting a backup offer to stay competitive without fully committing until the primary contract concludes.

#### **6. Pending Sales: 45 Properties Approaching Closing**

A total of **45 homes are pending sale** across the Santa Clarita Valley, meaning they have accepted offers and are moving toward closing. Pending status signifies that inspections, appraisals, and final lender approval are likely underway. Areas like Newhall and Canyon Country often see higher pending numbers, reflecting steady buyer demand. This figure is a positive indicator for sellers, as it reflects a stable flow of transactions in the market, benefiting both buyers and sellers interested in a smooth and timely transaction.

#### **7. Closed Sales: 45 Homes Successfully Sold**

This week, **45 homes have successfully closed** escrow in Santa Clarita, marking completed transactions across the Valley. This number highlights buyer confidence, as it reflects those who have finalized their purchases and moved into properties from Acton to Castaic. Closed sales are valuable benchmarks for both buyers and sellers, as they establish current market values and help set realistic expectations for pricing and negotiation.

#### **8. Expired Listings: 7 Homes That Did Not Sell in the Listing Period**

In the past week, **7 listings expired**, meaning their listing period ended without a sale. This status can occur for various reasons, including overpricing or changing seller circumstances. For sellers in competitive areas like Valencia and Stevenson Ranch, an expired listing can signal the need for a reassessment of marketing strategies, potentially adjusting the price, or staging enhancements to attract more interest.

#### **9. Canceled Listings: 11 Homes Withdrawn from the Market**

There have been **11 canceled listings** in Santa Clarita Valley this week, meaning these properties were withdrawn from the market before their expiration date. Sellers may cancel for reasons such as deciding to delay the sale or re-evaluate their pricing strategy. For interested buyers, canceled listings might reappear in the future, potentially with adjusted prices or new terms, making them worthwhile to watch if they align with specific needs.

#### **10. Hold Status: 7 Properties Temporarily Paused**

Seven properties are on hold, a temporary status indicating that these homes are unavailable for showings or offers for a certain period. This can happen due to repairs, tenant transitions, or other seller-specific situations. Buyers searching in Saugus, Castaic, or Agua Dulce can revisit these properties later, as they are likely to resume active status once the seller is ready.

#### **11. Withdrawn Listings: 6 Properties Fully Removed from the MLS**

Finally, **6 properties have been withdrawn** from the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), meaning they have been removed entirely and will not be actively marketed. Withdrawn listings reflect a more permanent removal compared to canceled or hold statuses. Buyers should consider withdrawn listings as off-market, although some may reappear later under new terms.

### Market Summary and Key Takeaways

The Santa Clarita Valley real estate market remains active and competitive, with a variety of status updates that reflect shifting trends and seasonal adjustments. As we approach winter, fewer new listings may emerge, while existing properties adjust prices or adopt strategic changes to attract committed buyers.

For **buyers**, now is an excellent time to explore options in unique communities like Acton and Agua Dulce, where rural charm, larger properties, and specialized financing options can provide excellent value. With new listings and adjusted prices in areas like Valencia, Saugus, and Canyon Country, buyers may find appealing opportunities without the heightened competition of the spring and summer markets.

For **sellers**, understanding these weekly dynamics can help with timely price adjustments, strategic marketing, and positioning homes to stand out in a shifting market. Sellers in Valencia, Stevenson Ranch, and other sought-after neighborhoods should consider the timing of their listing, using these insights to align their strategy with buyer interest levels.

Whether you're a buyer looking for more space or a seller ready to capitalize on this niche market, understanding the trends and nuances of Acton and Agua Dulce real estate is key.

### 2. November 2024 Market Update: Key Trends in Acton and Agua Dulce

For buyers and sellers, understanding current market dynamics is critical, so let’s break down the numbers:

### 3. Why Acton and Agua Dulce Are Unique in Santa Clarita Real Estate

Unlike the densely populated areas of Santa Clarita, Acton and Agua Dulce offer something different: open spaces, larger parcels of land, and a rural vibe that’s becoming increasingly rare near Los Angeles. Here’s why these communities stand out:

#### a) **Equestrian and Rural Zoning**

Acton and Agua Dulce are some of the few communities in Santa Clarita where **equestrian zoning** is common. This appeals to horse owners, agriculture enthusiasts, and those seeking self-sufficiency. Buyers interested in maintaining livestock or adding barns and other rural structures will find a welcoming environment here.

#### b) **Spacious Lots and Acreage**

From multi-acre properties to large single-family lots, these areas cater to buyers who want space. Properties here range from half-acre lots to expansive 10+ acre estates, offering plenty of room for additional dwelling units (ADUs), recreational activities, or simply more privacy.

#### c) **Diverse Pricing Options**

Whether you’re looking for a rural starter home around $450,000 or a sprawling estate over $3 million, Acton and Agua Dulce cover a range of budgets. This variety appeals to both entry-level buyers and those seeking luxury or multi-generational homes.

#### d) **Strong Community Appeal**

Acton and Agua Dulce’s communities are tight-knit, with residents often seeking a rural, slower-paced lifestyle. This means that buyers moving into these areas are often looking for long-term homes rather than short-term investments, which can add stability to the local market.

### 4. Seasonal Market Insights: Timing Your Move

Acton and Agua Dulce’s real estate market follows a seasonal pattern. During winter, listings may be fewer due to weather conditions, which can affect accessibility on rural roads. Spring and summer are prime selling seasons, offering easier access, better curb appeal, and increased buyer interest. Sellers looking for optimal offers often list in the warmer months, while buyers can find more motivated sellers in winter.

### 5. Understanding the Local Infrastructure

Acton and Agua Dulce offer a unique rural infrastructure that buyers should understand before moving forward:

#### a) **Water and Septic Systems**

Many homes in Acton and Agua Dulce rely on **well water** and **septic systems**. For some properties, water is trucked in due to limited groundwater. While these systems are reliable and often preferred by rural homeowners, buyers should ensure inspections are thorough. Septic tanks, for example, should be pumped and inspected, especially for properties where maintenance may not have been regular.

#### b) **Alternative Power and Solar Options**

Because of the rural setting, many properties in these areas use solar power and battery storage to reduce dependency on city utilities. This makes Acton and Agua Dulce attractive to environmentally conscious buyers interested in sustainable living.

#### c) **Internet and Connectivity**

Contrary to what many assume, Acton and Agua Dulce are well-connected, with options for internet and telecommunications. However, it’s always wise for buyers to check connectivity for specific addresses if high-speed internet is a priority.

### 6. Financing and Loan Considerations for Acton and Agua Dulce

Financing rural properties in Acton and Agua Dulce can differ from conventional home loans. Here’s a quick breakdown of loan types to consider:

	- **USDA Loans**: Often available for rural properties, USDA loans can offer favorable terms, including zero down payment. However, not all properties qualify, so it’s essential to verify eligibility early.

	- **FHA and VA Loans**: Common in these areas, FHA and VA loans are great for buyers with limited down payments. However, rural properties sometimes need additional inspections to ensure they meet loan standards.

	- **Conventional Loans**: For buyers with larger down payments, conventional loans are straightforward, but buyers should still check that their property meets any specific lender criteria for rural locations.

If you’re buying in Acton or Agua Dulce, it’s essential to work with a knowledgeable realtor who understands these financing nuances. With the right guidance, you can avoid delays and navigate any potential challenges smoothly.
