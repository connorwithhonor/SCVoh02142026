**November 23, 2024 – Day 328 of the Year – Week 47**

As we prepare to gather for Thanksgiving and reflect on what matters most, the Castaic real estate market reminds us that opportunities abound for both buyers and sellers. This past week has been active, with new listings, price changes, and homes moving through the market. Let’s dive into the details and explore what it means for you.

### **This Week’s Market Snapshot**

Over the past seven days, the Castaic residential real estate market has shown significant activity across various property types, including single-family homes, townhomes, condos, and small multi-family properties. Here’s the breakdown:

	- **Coming Soon:**&nbsp;1 property listed as coming soon—something to watch!

	- **New Listings:**&nbsp;5 fresh opportunities entered the market, bringing variety for buyers.

	- **Price Changes:**&nbsp;9 listings had price adjustments, showing that sellers are open to negotiation.

	- **Back on Market:**&nbsp;1 home returned to the market, giving buyers a second chance.

	- **Active Under Contract:**&nbsp;3 homes went into escrow, reflecting solid buyer demand.

	- **Pending Sales:**&nbsp;1 additional home is close to closing.

	- **Closed Sales:**&nbsp;5 transactions were finalized, proving deals are happening.

	- **Expired Listings:**&nbsp;1 property failed to sell during its listing period.

	- **Withdrawn Listings:**&nbsp;1 seller decided to pull their home off the market, at least temporarily.

	- **Hold Listings:**&nbsp;4 properties are on hold, possibly regrouping before re-entering the market.

### **Buyers: What This Market Means for You**

If you’re in the market to buy a home in Castaic, now is the time to act strategically. With five new listings and nine price changes, there are clear opportunities to find a home that fits your budget and lifestyle.

	- 
	**Negotiate with Confidence:**

	Sellers adjusting their prices are signaling flexibility. Don’t shy away from making an offer—even if it’s below the asking price. As I always say, "This is real estate, not retail. Everything is negotiable."

	

	- 
	**Be Ready to Act:**

	Properties going under contract quickly indicate strong demand. Have your loan pre-approval ready and work with a knowledgeable agent who can help you move fast when the right home pops up.

	

	- 
	**Envision the Possibilities:**

	As you tour homes this week, imagine how they’ll feel during your favorite holiday traditions. Look beyond the décor and see the potential for creating memories in the space.

	

### **Sellers: Tips to Attract Buyers in a Competitive Market**

Selling during the holiday season can be a strategic move if done right. Here’s how you can capitalize on the current market conditions:

	- 
	**Price Competitively from the Start:**

	With nine price changes this week, it’s clear that buyers are looking for value. A competitively priced home attracts attention and minimizes time on the market.

	

	- 
	**Stage for Success:**

	A well-staged home can make all the difference. If you’re worried about clutter, use your garage for storage. Just leave enough room for buyers to see the walls and any built-in storage. As I like to remind my clients, "The goal is to show the potential, not overwhelm with personal items."

	

	- 
	**Decorate Tastefully:**

	While it’s tempting to go all-out with holiday decorations, keep it neutral. Buyers should see your home, not just the holiday. Simple, cozy touches—like the smell of cinnamon or a neatly decorated mantel—can create a welcoming atmosphere.

	

	- 
	**Highlight the Perks:**

	If you have outdoor space, especially near Castaic Lake, make sure buyers see its potential. Whether it’s a backyard ready for entertaining or proximity to recreational activities, showcase what makes your property stand out.

	

### **The Castaic Advantage**

Castaic is a unique market with something for everyone. Its range of property types—from single-family homes to condos and duplexes—caters to a variety of buyers. Plus, its location near the Castaic Lake Recreation Area makes it a magnet for families and outdoor enthusiasts.

For buyers, the steady flow of inventory and price adjustments means opportunities to find the right home at the right price. For sellers, serious buyers remain active during the holiday season, making this an ideal time to list and close before the new year.

### **Interest Rates: A Key Factor**

Current mortgage rates are holding steady around&nbsp;**7.5%**, a far cry from the lows we saw in recent years but still historically reasonable. My advice? “Marry the house, not the loan.” Interest rates are temporary, and refinancing opportunities will arise if rates drop in the future. The key is finding a home that meets your needs and fits your long-term goals.

### **Looking Ahead: 2025 Market Expectations**

As we approach 2025, the real estate market in Castaic and the greater Santa Clarita Valley is likely to remain competitive. Here’s what to consider:

	- **For Buyers:**&nbsp;Start the year strong by getting pre-approved and staying informed about new listings.

	- **For Sellers:**&nbsp;Plan to list your home early in the year when buyer activity typically surges after the holidays.
