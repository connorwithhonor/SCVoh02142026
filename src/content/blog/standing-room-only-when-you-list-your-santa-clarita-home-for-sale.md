How many professionals can I bring with me when I list your home for sale? It is going to depend on what your home needs which results on what professionals that I bring with me when I come to list your home.

**How Many Professionals Can I Bring with Me When I List Your Home for Sale?**

The number of professionals I bring to your home will depend entirely on what your home needs. This is all about ensuring that your home is market-ready and presented in the best possible light to potential buyers.

Most home sellers don't need every single professional on this list, but rest assured, I have access to all of them at a moment's notice to meet your specific needs.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
