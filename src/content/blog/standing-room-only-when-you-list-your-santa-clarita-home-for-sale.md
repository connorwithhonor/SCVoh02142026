How many professionals can I bring with me when I list your home for sale? It is going to depend on what your home needs which results on what professionals that I bring with me when I come to list your home.

**How Many Professionals Can I Bring with Me When I List Your Home for Sale?**

The number of professionals I bring to your home will depend entirely on what your home needs. This is all about ensuring that your home is market-ready and presented in the best possible light to potential buyers.

	- **Types of Professionals I May Bring:**

	
		**Roofer**

		- **Cleaner**

		- **Foundation Expert**

		- **Surveyor**

		- **Appraiser**

		- **Plumber**

		- **Electrician**

		- **Mold Remediation Specialist**

		- **Structural Expert**

		- **Lender**

		- **Home Inspector**

		- **Pool Inspector**

		- **Home Stager**

		- **Trash-Out Services**

		- **Organizer**

		- **Tax Advisor**

		- **Wealth Manager**

		- **Accountant or CPA**

		- **Handypeople**

		- **Painters**

		- **Window and Door Specialists**

		- **Photographer**

	

	

Most home sellers don't need every single professional on this list, but rest assured, I have access to all of them at a moment's notice to meet your specific needs.

### **What to Expect from a Connor with Honor Listing Experience:**

	- 
	**![](https://idx-acnt-ihouseprd.b-cdn.net/AR1197716/file_manager/521%20active%20homes%204%20sale%20in%20the%20Santa%20Clarita%20Valley%20by%20Connor%20with%20Honor.png?width=450&amp;height=253&amp;aspect_ratio=450%3A253)Streamlined Process:** After our initial assessment, I bring together a tailored team of professionals to ensure there are very few loose ends. We coordinate everything to make the listing process seamless.

	

	- 
	**Setting the Right Price:** We establish a competitive sales price for your home. This is not just a guess—we base it on detailed market analysis and the insights provided by appraisers and other real estate professionals.

	

	- 
	**Minimizing Costs:** We determine the exact costs of any necessary changes to help you achieve the highest possible sale price with the least out-of-pocket expenses during escrow.

	

	- 
	**Expert Financial Guidance:** If you choose, our financial advisors can help you understand the best ways to use the funds from your sale with the least tax consequences. Many of our sellers appreciate this service as it adds another layer of confidence to their decisions.

	

	- 
	**Tailored to Market Conditions:**

	
		Most sellers opt for home staging services, but if the market demands it, some prefer the "full tilt" experience. In a strong seller's market, going all-in is often the best way to maximize your home's value.

		- A pre-sale home inspection and potentially a pre-market appraisal can position you to resolve potential problems before they become costly demands from buyers. For example, if an inspection reveals that your air conditioning is about to fail, you could save hundreds of dollars in repair costs that a buyer might demand. Instead, you can use a home warranty to get the system repaired or negotiate its replacement.

	

	

### **Real-Life Example: Roof Repairs During a Connor with Honor Experience**

	- Recently, I conducted a listing presentation for sellers in Northpark. While they decided not to sell until 2025, this experience is worth mentioning:
	
		The sellers were considering a sale, either now or later. I coordinated with my team and arranged an appointment with the homeowners.

		- The home was a 3,300-square-foot, two-story property with RV parking and a large, terraced backyard with stunning views. My team immediately got to work, assessing the property and preparing recommendations.

		- One recommendation came from Steve Belgau, a respected roofer in Santa Clarita, CA. He discovered two tears in the roofing paper, which could cause leaks if it rained. The sellers decided to delay listing until 2025, but they got the roof repaired. A week later, it rained heavily, confirming the wisdom of their decision.

		- **Was it worth it? Absolutely.** Even if you choose not to sell after my presentation, you may learn something valuable that saves you stress and money in the future.

	

	

### **Connecting You with the Right People:**

	- There have been instances where clients met the perfect professional—like a financial planner or wealth advisor—through the process of considering a home sale with Connor with Honor.

	- You might not have considered speaking with a financial advisor before, but by choosing me to sell your home, you could find a professional you trust and connect with.

### **It's All About the Right Team:**

	- It's not just about selling a home; it's about assembling the right team to support you throughout the process. Working with people you trust and feel comfortable with is key to making the most of your life and maximizing the value of your home.

	- It starts with getting the right people on your bus and making sure everyone is headed in the same direction.
