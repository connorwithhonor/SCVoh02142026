# Shocking Dip in Santa Clarita Listings: Is Now the Time to Buy?

**TL;DR**: Santa Clarita’s real estate market just took a surprising turn, dropping from over 800 listings to 753 in just weeks as of August 27, 2025. This shift signals a potential cooling period as school season kicks in, but opportunities like “coming soon” listings and strategic buying could give you an edge. As a former LAPD officer turned Realtor (CALDRE 01238257), I’ll break down what this means for buyers and sellers, how to navigate the market, and why working with a local expert like me at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/) can make or break your deal. Book a free consultation at [https://zoommescv.com/](https://zoommescv.com/) or call 661-888-4983 to strategize.

## The Santa Clarita Real Estate Rollercoaster: What’s Happening?

As someone who’s walked the walk—from patrolling LAPD streets to mastering the Santa Clarita real estate game—I’m here to give you the no-BS scoop on what’s happening in our market. On August 27, 2025, at 8:26 AM PDT, the Santa Clarita Valley real estate market saw a jaw-dropping dip in active listings, falling from over 800 to 753. That’s a significant shift in just three weeks, and it’s got buyers and sellers buzzing. Let’s dive into what this means, why it’s happening, and how you can capitalize on it.

### Why the Sudden Drop in Listings?

The drop from 800+ to 753 active listings is a big deal. Here’s why this is happening:

	- **School’s Back in Session**: August marks the return of school, which often slows down the real estate market. Families are less likely to move when kids are settling into new routines. This seasonal shift can reduce the number of homes hitting the market, as seen in our latest data.

	- **Market Cooling?**: The Santa Clarita market has been hot, with inventory peaking at 505 listings earlier this year—the highest in over two years. This dip could signal a cooling period, where sellers are holding off or buyers are snapping up properties faster than new ones are listed.

	- **Economic Factors**: Recent Federal Reserve rate cuts to 4.75–5.00% are stirring the pot. Lower rates are spurring refinance calls and could be encouraging some buyers to jump in, reducing available inventory.

This shift isn’t just numbers—it’s a signal. For buyers, it means less competition if you act fast. For sellers, it’s a reminder to price strategically to avoid sitting on the market.

### The “Coming Soon” Goldmine: Get Ahead of the Game

One of the juiciest opportunities right now is the 10 “coming soon” listings in Santa Clarita. These are properties not yet officially on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), meaning they’re hidden from syndication sites like Zillow or Redfin. Here’s the deal:

	- **Exclusive Access**: These listings are only available via email through services like [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/comingsoon](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/comingsoon). As a local Realtor, I can get you access to these before they hit the open market, giving you a head start.

	- **Why It Matters**: Pre-market listings let you negotiate before the masses swarm in. This is especially crucial in a market where multiple offers are common.

Want in? Head to [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/comingsoon](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/comingsoon) and sign up to get these exclusive listings. Or, better yet, call me at 661-888-4983 to dial in your search for specific needs—bedrooms, bathrooms, or that dream pool.

## Market Snapshot: What’s Moving in Santa Clarita?

Let’s break down the latest market activity for the past seven days, as of August 27, 2025:

	- **7 Coming Soon Listings**: A slight drop from the 10 mentioned, showing how fast these opportunities move.

	- **69 Price Changes**: Lower than recent weeks, indicating sellers are getting savvier about pricing to attract buyers.

	- **80 Back on Market**: Properties that fell out of escrow are re-entering, often due to buyer issues, not the homes themselves.

	- **32 Active Under Contract**: These homes are in escrow but still active, meaning backup offers could still win.

	- **55 Pending, 56 Sold**: Sales are steady, showing demand remains strong despite the inventory dip.

	- **11 Expired, 25 Canceled, 13 On Hold**: Some sellers are pulling back, possibly waiting for a better market window.

This snapshot tells us the market is still active but showing signs of stabilization. Buyers need to move quickly, and sellers must price competitively to avoid being part of the “expired” or “canceled” crowd.

### Schools and Safety: Why Santa Clarita Stands Out

Santa Clarita’s appeal isn’t just about homes—it’s about lifestyle. As a former LAPD officer, I know safety and community matter. Here’s why Santa Clarita is a draw:

	- **Top Schools**: Families are relocating from Los Angeles to avoid private school costs, thanks to Santa Clarita’s strong public schools. This is a major driver for buyers, especially now that school’s back in session.

	- **Safety First**: Before you buy, check with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department about the neighborhood. Just give them the address and ask for insights. My LAPD background taught me the importance of due diligence—don’t skip this step.

	- **Affordability**: Compared to Los Angeles, Santa Clarita offers better value for your dollar, with homes in various price ranges.

## Buyer Beware: Navigating the New Rules

The real estate game has changed, and buyers need to be sharp. As of September 2024, California mandates written buyer agreements to even view homes. Here’s what you need to know:

### Why Written Agreements Matter

	- **Protection**: A buyer-broker agreement clarifies your relationship with your Realtor, outlining fees and expectations.

	- **Negotiation Power**: With an agreement, your agent can negotiate concessions, like seller-paid closing costs, which can save you thousands.

	- **Avoid Scams**: Don’t sign anything without reading it. I’ve seen too many buyers get burned by shady agents. My LAPD-honed instincts ensure you’re protected.

### Key Considerations Before Signing

	- **FICO Scores and Pre-Approval**: Your credit score (FICO) is critical. Avoid major purchases before buying to keep your score strong.

	- **Down Payments**: Down payment amounts are rising in Santa Clarita. Get pre-approved to know your budget.

	- **Inspections**: Never skip a home inspection. It’s your safety net against costly surprises.

Need help navigating these new rules? Call me at 661-888-4983 or visit [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/buying-a-home-key-considerations-before-signing-a-buyer-broker-agreement](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/buying-a-home-key-considerations-before-signing-a-buyer-broker-agreement) for a deep dive.

## Sellers: Price Smart or Pay the Price

Sellers, listen up: pricing your home too high is a death sentence in this market. Here’s how to win:

	- **Set the Right Price**: Use a net sheet to understand your proceeds after commissions and fees.

	- **Concessions Are Key**: Offering concessions, like covering buyer closing costs, can make your home stand out.

	- **First Impressions Matter**: Stage your home to shine. A cluttered or dated home will scare buyers away.

## Financing in 2025: Rates, Lenders, and More

With the Fed cutting rates, mortgage rates are inching closer to the “magic number” that sparks buyer frenzy. Here’s the lowdown:

	- **Rate Trends**: Rates are down to 4.75–5.00%, making now a better time to buy or refinance.

	- **Lender Options**: From banks to credit unions, each has pros and cons. I can connect you with legitimate lenders.
