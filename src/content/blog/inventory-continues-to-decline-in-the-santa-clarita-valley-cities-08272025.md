# Shocking Dip in Santa Clarita Listings: Is Now the Time to Buy?

**TL;DR**: Santa Clarita’s real estate market just took a surprising turn, dropping from over 800 listings to 753 in just weeks as of August 27, 2025. This shift signals a potential cooling period as school season kicks in, but opportunities like “coming soon” listings and strategic buying could give you an edge. As a former LAPD officer turned Realtor (CALDRE 01238257), I’ll break down what this means for buyers and sellers, how to navigate the market, and why working with a local expert like me at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/](/) can make or break your deal.

## The Santa Clarita Real Estate Rollercoaster: What’s Happening?

As someone who’s walked the walk—from patrolling LAPD streets to mastering the Santa Clarita real estate game—I’m here to give you the no-BS scoop on what’s happening in our market. On August 27, 2025, at 8:26 AM PDT, the Santa Clarita Valley real estate market saw a jaw-dropping dip in active listings, falling from over 800 to 753. That’s a significant shift in just three weeks, and it’s got buyers and sellers buzzing. Let’s dive into what this means, why it’s happening, and how you can capitalize on it.

### Why the Sudden Drop in Listings?

The drop from 800+ to 753 active listings is a big deal. Here’s why this is happening:

This shift isn’t just numbers—it’s a signal. For buyers, it means less competition if you act fast. For sellers, it’s a reminder to price strategically to avoid sitting on the market.

### The “Coming Soon” Goldmine: Get Ahead of the Game

One of the juiciest opportunities right now is the 10 “coming soon” listings in Santa Clarita. These are properties not yet officially on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), meaning they’re hidden from syndication sites like Zillow or Redfin. Here’s the deal:

Want in? Head to https://www./blog/comingsoon and sign up to get these exclusive listings. Or, better yet, call me at 661-888-4983 to dial in your search for specific needs—bedrooms, bathrooms, or that dream pool.

## Market Snapshot: What’s Moving in Santa Clarita?

Let’s break down the latest market activity for the past seven days, as of August 27, 2025:

This snapshot tells us the market is still active but showing signs of stabilization. Buyers need to move quickly, and sellers must price competitively to avoid being part of the “expired” or “canceled” crowd.

### Schools and Safety: Why Santa Clarita Stands Out

Santa Clarita’s appeal isn’t just about homes—it’s about lifestyle. As a former LAPD officer, I know safety and community matter. Here’s why Santa Clarita is a draw:

## Buyer Beware: Navigating the New Rules

The real estate game has changed, and buyers need to be sharp. As of September 2024, California mandates written buyer agreements to even view homes. Here’s what you need to know:

## Sellers: Price Smart or Pay the Price

Sellers, listen up: pricing your home too high is a death sentence in this market. Here’s how to win:
