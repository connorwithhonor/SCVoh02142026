### Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Update - July 20, 2024

![](https://idx-acnt-ihouseprd.b-cdn.net/AR1197716/file_manager/Santa%20Clarita%20news%20and%20market%20update%20housing%20inventory%20and%20rising%20numbers.jpg?width=500&amp;height=496&amp;aspect_ratio=500%3A496)Good morning, Santa Clarita! Connor with Honor here, bringing you the latest insights and updates from our vibrant local real estate market.

#### Market Insights

#### Sneak Peek from My Upcoming Book

In one of the chapters, I delve into the potential pitfalls in real estate, including too-good-to-be-true offers and scams designed to collect personal information or sell harmful products. Staying informed and vigilant is essential to protect your investments and personal data.

#### Additional Insights

The market's upward trend in listings could mean a potential shift in market dynamics. Interest rates might see a change in September, which could further impact the buying cycle. If rates drop significantly, it could create a surge in buying activity, reminiscent of previous market conditions with multiple offers on properties.

If you are considering purchasing real estate and you're able to qualify, it might be wise to act before any significant interest rate drops. Lower rates could lead to a massive buying cycle, moving through the current inventory quickly and potentially returning to a highly competitive market with multiple offers on properties.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
