# Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Update: July 2025 Snapshot and Insider Tips

The Santa Clarita Valley real estate market is buzzing with activity, and if you’re a homebuyer or seller, you need to stay ahead of the curve. As of July 6, 2025, the market is showing a balanced absorption rate, with new listings and closed sales nearly neck-and-neck. Whether you’re eyeing a dream home in Valencia or planning to sell in Saugus, understanding the latest trends is crucial. Connor MacIvor, aka Connor with Honor, a first-responder-turned-realtor, breaks down the current market snapshot and shares expert tips to help you navigate this dynamic landscape. Let’s dive into the numbers and strategies that can give you an edge.

## TL;DR

The Santa Clarita Valley real estate market is steady, with 51 new listings and 48 closed sales over the past seven days as of July 6, 2025. Inventory is stagnating around 760–770 active listings, nearly double January’s numbers, but low mortgage rates are keeping some sellers hesitant. Buyers should tap into coming soon listings for a competitive advantage, while sellers need strategic pricing to stand out. Work with a local expert like Connor MacIvor at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com to seize opportunities in this balanced market.

## Understanding the Santa Clarita Market: A 7-Day Snapshot

The past week offers a clear picture of Santa Clarita’s real estate pulse. According to Connor MacIvor’s latest update, 51 properties hit the market, while 48 successfully closed. This near-equal absorption rate suggests a balanced market where supply and demand are closely aligned. However, the market isn’t without its nuances.

### New Listings and Closings

With 51 new listings, buyers have fresh options to explore, from condos in Canyon Country to single-family homes in Stevenson Ranch. The 48 closed sales indicate strong buyer interest, but the slight edge in new listings hints at growing inventory. This balance is a sweet spot for both buyers and sellers, offering opportunities to act strategically.

Check out the latest properties on [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com’s active listings page](/) to stay updated on new homes hitting the market daily.

### Inventory Trends: 760–770 Active Listings

Santa Clarita’s inventory is hovering around 760–770 active listings, a significant jump from January’s numbers, which were nearly half as many. This increase provides buyers with more choices, but it’s not an oversupply. Connor notes that many sellers are holding onto their homes due to “golden handcuffs”—low mortgage rates from years past that make relocating less appealing. This reluctance keeps the market from flooding with listings, maintaining a delicate equilibrium.

Explore homes across price ranges, from under $500,000 to over $1 million, to find your perfect fit.

### Expired Listings and Seller Strategies

An uptick in expired listings—properties that didn’t sell within their contractual period—signals a need for sellers to rethink their approach. Connor observes that some sellers are opting not to relist immediately, possibly seeking new agents or adjusting their pricing. If you’re selling, this is a reminder to price competitively and work with an experienced realtor who understands local trends.

### Coming Soon Listings: A Buyer’s Secret Weapon

One of Connor’s top tips for buyers is to access coming soon listings. These 11 properties, not yet visible on major syndication sites like Zillow, give buyers a head start. To see these exclusive listings, you need an agent to email them to you or visit SantaClaritaComingSoon.com. This insider access can make all the difference in a competitive market.

## Why the Market Feels Balanced but Tricky

The near-equal number of new listings and closings creates a balanced market, but underlying factors add complexity. Low mortgage rates from previous years are anchoring some sellers, while rising inventory gives buyers more leverage. Here’s what this means for you.

### For Buyers: More Choices, More Competition

With 760–770 active listings, buyers have a wider selection than earlier this year. Neighborhoods like [Valencia](/) and Castaic offer diverse options, from new construction to homes with pools. However, desirable properties still attract multiple offers, especially those priced competitively.

Connor advises buyers to get pre-approved to strengthen their offers. Visit the [mortgage rates page](/blog) to understand current financing options and connect with trusted lenders.

### For Sellers: Pricing is Everything

Sellers face a market where strategic pricing is critical. The rise in expired listings suggests that overpricing can lead to missed opportunities. Connor’s blog highlights that homes priced too high often languish, as seen in his post on pricing mistakes. To attract buyers, consider offering concessions or staging your home to make a strong first impression.
