## TL;DR (Read This If You’re Rushing Between Showings)

## Why This Update Matters (and What You’ll Get Here)

I keep these market reports simple, useful, and honest. Today I’ll:

If you want hand-holding through an offer, inspection, or pricing strategy, book me at **ZoomMeSCV.com**. If you want to roam every listing and sold comp in town, start at **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com**.

## Today’s Numbers — October 24, 2025

### 7‑Day Snapshot

### Current Totals

### What It Means

## Property Types in Santa Clarita (Know Exactly What You’re Buying)

Not all “houses” are the same. In SCV you’ll see a mix, and your insurance, noise level, HOA rules, and resale all hinge on which one you pick.

### 1) Attached Single‑Family Residence (SFR)

Looks like a house, acts like a house — **shares a wall** somewhere. That shared wall could be the garage, a living room wall, or another structural element. What it means for you:

### 2) Detached Condominium

It looks like a regular SFR and sits on its own pad, but legally it’s a **condo**. You get the feel of a house with a **condo ownership structure**.

### 3) Planned Unit Development (PUD)

Typically a fee‑simple home with common areas maintained by an HOA.

### 4) Zero‑Lot Line

Tight lots, sometimes with one wall at or near the boundary.

### 5) Classic SFR on a Larger Lot

The older pockets with **6,000–7,000 sq. ft.** lots (and up) give you breathing room.

**Bottom line:** Property type isn’t just a label — it changes your **insurance**, **daily experience**, **rules**, and **resale**. Make your selection with eyes open.

## Insurance in 2025: Why You Vet It in Week One

Insurance isn’t impossible — it’s just **stickier and slower**. You get smoother closings when you:

If you’re buying an attached SFR or a detached condo with a master policy, make sure your agent explains the **layers** (master vs. your coverage) and where gaps could exist (loss assessment, interior upgrades, water backup).

## The Perfect Seven‑Day Due Diligence Game Plan

If you start strong, you finish strong. Here’s how I structure the first week after offer acceptance.

### Day 0 (Acceptance Day)

### Day 1

### Day 2

### Day 3

### Day 4

### Day 5

### Day 6

### Day 7

## The Neighbor Knock (Done Right)

Within the first few days of escrow, **introduce yourself** to the neighbors:

Your agent should facilitate the intro, then step back so neighbors can talk freely. And yes, I’m still there — to keep the peace and catch facts that matter.

## Inspection Etiquette and Strategy

## Write It Down or It Didn’t Happen (Paper Trail 101)

Phone calls are great for speed; **emails are great for proof**. When you get a critical answer (school boundary, pet policy, shed rules), memorialize it like this:

Subject: Follow‑up on School Boundary for [Property Address]

Hi [Name],

Thanks for speaking with me today. My family is buying [Address], and you confirmed that our child would be eligible to attend [School Name] based on current boundaries and capacity for the [Year] school year. Please reply to confirm I understood this correctly.

Best,

Connor

If the person doesn’t respond, call back, confirm they saw it, and ask for a reply. If they moved departments or it was their last day, repeat the process with the new contact. Your future self will be grateful you have **names, titles, dates, and written confirmation**.

## Using SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com Like a Pro

## The Hard Question You Should Ask Every Agent

**“When was the last time you killed a deal — on purpose — to protect your client?”**

If the answer is “never,” that’s a red flag. Deals die when major defects can’t be reconciled, when sellers won’t budge on safety issues, or when buyers can’t live with a lifestyle constraint revealed in escrow. A great agent knows when to **step off the gas** — and has the spine to advise you accordingly.

## Micro‑Market Notes (High‑Level)

If you want a hyper‑granular breakdown of any one of these, call me — I’ll tailor a search, walk the comps, and map a purchase plan.

## Buyer FAQ (Fast, Useful, No Fluff)

**Q1: Should I waive the inspection to win?**

No. Tighten timelines, increase earnest money, or focus on credits instead. Don’t waive knowledge.

**Q2: What’s the difference between AUC and Pending?**

**Active Under Contract (AUC)** means contingencies remain and backups may be welcome. **Pending** means it’s further along; backups less likely to stick.

**Q3: How fast should I start insurance?**

Day 1. Rates and availability depend on specifics. Don’t let insurance be the slow anchor.

**Q4: Can I bring the family to inspection?**

Yes, but brief them: observe, don’t distract. Save questions for the debrief.

**Q5: What if the appraisal comes in low?**

Options: price reduction, split the gap, buyer adds cash, or cancel under appraisal contingency.

**Q6: Who verifies school boundaries?**

You do — and you get it in **writing** with names, titles, and dates.

**Q7: Are detached condos really condos?**

Legally, yes. Insurance and HOA coverage differ from SFRs. Know what the master policy covers.

**Q8: What if the neighbor’s tree hangs over my yard?**

Find out maintenance history and responsibilities during escrow. Consider a written understanding.

**Q9: How do I handle 76 price changes in a week?**

Set alerts, preview in person fast, and write clean terms. Speed wins without overpaying.

**Q10: When should I walk away?**

When safety issues go unfixed, lifestyle non‑negotiables fail, or the numbers break your plan.

## Seller FAQ (Direct Answers You Can Use Today)

**Q1: Should I price at yesterday’s comp?**

No. Price to **today’s** market. Your first 7–10 days set your fate.

**Q2: Do I need pre‑inspection?**

It can surface issues and build trust. At minimum, fix obvious safety and function items.

**Q3: Should I be at the buyer’s inspection?**

No. Be reachable by phone. Keep negotiations professional and documented.

**Q4: What’s the most common mistake in SCV listings?**

Waiting for the market to “catch up” to your price. The market doesn’t chase; it punishes.

**Q5: Can I refuse repairs?**

Yes, but expect either credits, a price response, or a buyer who walks on major items.

**Q6: How do I handle multiple offers?**

Set criteria in advance: price, terms, appraisal gap, timelines. Don’t move goalposts mid‑game.

**Q7: Do small cosmetic fixes matter?**

Yes. Fresh caulk, touch‑up paint, working bulbs, and clean filters read as “well‑kept.”

**Q8: Photos vs. speed to market?**

Always choose quality photos. Bad photos cost weeks.

**Q9: What about buyer credits instead of repairs?**

Great tool if timelines are tight. Credits avoid contractor delays.

**Q10: When should I kill a deal as a seller?**

When buyer performance is shaky, timelines slip without remedy, or inspection asks become unmanageable.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
