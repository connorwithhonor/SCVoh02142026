# Santa Clarita Real Estate, Straight From the Hip — October 24, 2025

*By Connor with Honor — SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com*

## TL;DR (Read This If You’re Rushing Between Showings)

	- 
	**Date:** Friday, October 24, 2025

	

	- 
	**7‑Day Snapshot (SCV):** 8 Coming Soon • 67 New • 76 Price Changes • 16 Back on Market • 29 Active Under Contract • 54 Pending • 66 Closed • 9 Expired • 14 Canceled • 13 Hold • 7 Withdrawn.

	

	- 
	**Current Totals:** **685 Active** today (up from **679** yesterday). **Coming Soon: 12**.

	

	- 
	**Takeaways:** Inventory is tight but inching. Pricing is still a moving target (76 price changes in seven days). If you’re a buyer, be ready with loan docs and an inspection game plan on Day 1. If you’re a seller, strategy beats stubbornness.

	

	- 
	**Today’s lesson:** Know your property type (attached SFR, detached condo, PUD, zero-lot) and how it impacts **insurance**, **noise transfer**, **HOA rules**, and **resale**.

	

	- 
	**Pro move:** Use SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com for real-time search (yes, the pop-up; give your info if you want me to call — or keep browsing). For questions that determine your quality of life (school boundaries, pets, sheds, HOA limits), **you** confirm in writing.

	

## Why This Update Matters (and What You’ll Get Here)

I keep these market reports simple, useful, and honest. Today I’ll:

	- 
	Give you the **current numbers** and what they mean in plain English.

	

	- 
	Teach you how to **read the tea leaves** on inventory, pricing, and pace.

	

	- 
	Break down **SCV property types** so you don’t get surprised by walls, fences, or insurance.

	

	- 
	Walk you through a **Day‑1 to Day‑7 due diligence** plan that saves deals and sanity.

	

	- 
	Share **inspection etiquette** that keeps emotions cool and results solid.

	

	- 
	Show you how to **document answers** so your future self (and kiddo) thank you.

	

	- 
	Arm you with **buyer and seller FAQs** you can skim before you write your offer or counter.

	

If you want hand-holding through an offer, inspection, or pricing strategy, book me at **ZoomMeSCV.com**. If you want to roam every listing and sold comp in town, start at **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com**.

## Today’s Numbers — October 24, 2025

### 7‑Day Snapshot

	- 
	Coming Soon: **8**

	

	- 
	New Listings: **67**

	

	- 
	Price Changes: **76**

	

	- 
	Back on Market: **16**

	

	- 
	Active Under Contract: **29**

	

	- 
	Pending: **54**

	

	- 
	Closed: **66**

	

	- 
	Expired: **9**

	

	- 
	Canceled: **14**

	

	- 
	Hold: **13**

	

	- 
	Withdrawn: **7**

	

### Current Totals

	- 
	**Total Active:** **685** today (**679** yesterday)

	

	- 
	**Coming Soon:** **12**

	

### What It Means

	- 
	**Inventory:** We gained a few actives. That sounds minor, but in a tight market, +6 day‑over‑day is momentum. If we string a few of these together, buyers get leverage. If it stalls, sellers keep the upper hand.

	

	- 
	**Pricing:** **76 price changes** in seven days means sellers are testing ceilings and meeting reality. As interest rates yo‑yo, buyers adjust monthly payments first, emotions second. Smart sellers price to the **market of the moment**, not the market of memory.

	

	- 
	**Pace:** **54 pending** and **66 closed** show real deal flow. If you’re writing offers, write with clean terms. If you’re listing, your first 7–10 days are the show — nail photos, prep, and pricing.

	

## Property Types in Santa Clarita (Know Exactly What You’re Buying)

Not all “houses” are the same. In SCV you’ll see a mix, and your insurance, noise level, HOA rules, and resale all hinge on which one you pick.

### 1) Attached Single‑Family Residence (SFR)

Looks like a house, acts like a house — **shares a wall** somewhere. That shared wall could be the garage, a living room wall, or another structural element. What it means for you:

	- 
	**Insurance:** A neighbor’s past water or fire claim can show up on your CLUE radar. Get your **CLUE report** early (Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange) so you aren’t blindsided by premiums.

	

	- 
	**Noise:** If the shared wall is living space, you may hear the band practice. If it’s garage-to-garage, you’ll likely hear less.

	

	- 
	**Resale:** Buyers ask about noise and insurance history. You’ll want documentation.

	

### 2) Detached Condominium

It looks like a regular SFR and sits on its own pad, but legally it’s a **condo**. You get the feel of a house with a **condo ownership structure**.

	- 
	**Insurance/HOA:** Expect a master policy plus your HO‑6 needs. Confirm what the master covers vs. you.

	

	- 
	**Lot Size:** Often smaller, often low‑maintenance. Great for lock‑and‑leave.

	

### 3) Planned Unit Development (PUD)

Typically a fee‑simple home with common areas maintained by an HOA.

	- 
	**Pros:** Community amenities, predictable neighborhood aesthetic.

	

	- 
	**Cons:** Rules, dues, and sometimes approvals for changes (sheds, exterior paint, solar placement).

	

### 4) Zero‑Lot Line

Tight lots, sometimes with one wall at or near the boundary.

	- 
	**Pros:** Efficient use of land, often newer communities, sometimes lower yard work.

	

	- 
	**Cons:** Fence and tree issues can surface sooner; be proactive about neighbor relations and maintenance boundaries.

	

### 5) Classic SFR on a Larger Lot

The older pockets with **6,000–7,000 sq. ft.** lots (and up) give you breathing room.

	- 
	**Pros:** Space, privacy, flexibility for future improvements.

	

	- 
	**Cons:** More upkeep; if older, pay attention to sewer, roof, electrical, and permitted work.

	

**Bottom line:** Property type isn’t just a label — it changes your **insurance**, **daily experience**, **rules**, and **resale**. Make your selection with eyes open.

## Insurance in 2025: Why You Vet It in Week One

Insurance isn’t impossible — it’s just **stickier and slower**. You get smoother closings when you:

	- 
	**Run CLUE early.** If the neighbor’s 2023 slab leak bled through your shared wall, your premiums may feel it.

	

	- 
	**Get multiple quotes.** Ask what’s driving the rate: roof age, brush clearance, claim history, community risk profile.

	

	- 
	**Lock coverage windows.** Your lender’s timeline depends on your binder. Don’t let insurance be the item that lags.

	

	- 
	**Document brush clearance and retrofits.** It can help with underwriting.

	

If you’re buying an attached SFR or a detached condo with a master policy, make sure your agent explains the **layers** (master vs. your coverage) and where gaps could exist (loss assessment, interior upgrades, water backup).

## The Perfect Seven‑Day Due Diligence Game Plan

If you start strong, you finish strong. Here’s how I structure the first week after offer acceptance.

### Day 0 (Acceptance Day)

	- 
	Celebrate for five minutes. Then send your **initial deposit** and book inspections.

	

	- 
	Ask your agent for the **seller disclosures** and any **permits** or **HOA docs** already on hand.

	

### Day 1

	- 
	Order **home inspection** (general) and schedule **specialists** if needed: roof, chimney, sewer scope, pool/spa, foundation, mold.

	

	- 
	**Insurance:** start quotes and request CLUE insights. Provide the exact property details to carriers.

	

	- 
	**Lender:** confirm rate lock conversation and appraisal order.

	

### Day 2

	- 
	Walk the neighborhood at different times: school drop‑off, evening return, weekend morning.

	

	- 
	Start your **lifestyle confirmations**: school boundaries, pet rules, parking restrictions, ADU or shed rules, short‑term rental policies (if relevant). **You** make the calls and get **names, emails, titles**.

	

### Day 3

	- 
	**Home inspection day etiquette:** Bring decision‑makers, not a circus. Let the inspector work in peace. Collect questions and save them for the **debrief**.

	

	- 
	If the **seller** asks to attend, I recommend **they don’t**. Not because anyone’s hiding anything — because emotions run high and verbal promises get made and forgotten. Keep it clean; keep it professional.

	

### Day 4

	- 
	Debrief with the inspector. Read the full report. Separate **safety/structural** from **deferred maintenance** and **cosmetics**.

	

	- 
	If big items pop, get **specialist bids** fast.

	

### Day 5

	- 
	Draft your **Request for Repairs** or **credit ask** with photos, reports, bids, and clear language.

	

	- 
	Prepare your **walk‑away threshold**. Some deals must be killed to save your future self grief.

	

### Day 6

	- 
	Review seller response. Check insurance quotes again if the inspection changed risk (e.g., roof age, plumbing type).

	

	- 
	Confirm appraisal schedule; discuss comps with your agent.

	

### Day 7

	- 
	Re‑verify any **lifestyle items** that were mission‑critical (school confirmation in writing, HOA pet approval in writing).

	

	- 
	If you’re satisfied, push forward to appraisal and loan milestones. If not, exercise your contingency rights cleanly and promptly.

	

## The Neighbor Knock (Done Right)

Within the first few days of escrow, **introduce yourself** to the neighbors:

	- 
	Hit **both sides** and the **rear neighbor** where fences or trees impact you.

	

	- 
	Ask about **major trees** with overhanging canopies, root intrusions, and fence maintenance histories.

	

	- 
	Listen for **band practice**, motorcycles at 6 a.m., or that friendly rooster.

	

	- 
	Take notes. If something would be a deal‑breaker in six months, deal with it in **six days**.

	

Your agent should facilitate the intro, then step back so neighbors can talk freely. And yes, I’m still there — to keep the peace and catch facts that matter.

## Inspection Etiquette and Strategy

	- 
	**Let the inspector inspect.** They’re focused, methodical, and usually covering dozens of systems. Constant interruptions lead to missed items.

	

	- 
	**Save questions for the debrief.** You’ll get better answers with the whole picture.

	

	- 
	**Sellers:** Don’t attend. Be reachable by phone. Avoid spontaneous concessions or debates that create vague verbal commitments.

	

	- 
	**Buyers:** Separate must‑haves from nice‑to‑haves. You can ask for everything; you’ll get further asking for what’s **defensible**.

	

## Write It Down or It Didn’t Happen (Paper Trail 101)

Phone calls are great for speed; **emails are great for proof**. When you get a critical answer (school boundary, pet policy, shed rules), memorialize it like this:

Subject: Follow‑up on School Boundary for [Property Address]

Hi [Name],

Thanks for speaking with me today. My family is buying [Address], and you confirmed that our child would be eligible to attend [School Name] based on current boundaries and capacity for the [Year] school year. Please reply to confirm I understood this correctly.

Best,

Connor

If the person doesn’t respond, call back, confirm they saw it, and ask for a reply. If they moved departments or it was their last day, repeat the process with the new contact. Your future self will be grateful you have **names, titles, dates, and written confirmation**.

## Using SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com Like a Pro

	- 
	**Search everything:** Every active listing, plus sold data for the homework that wins negotiations.

	

	- 
	**Yes, the pop‑up:** It asks for contact info. Give it and I’ll personally reach out. Or keep searching without it — you decide. The goal is to put power in your hands, not block you.

	

	- 
	**Saved searches:** Track micro‑markets (e.g., Valencia detached condos, Saugus homes with pools, Canyon Country single‑stories under a price cap).

	

	- 
	**Price‑change alerts:** With **76 price changes** in seven days, the right alert turns into the right offer.

	

## The Hard Question You Should Ask Every Agent

**“When was the last time you killed a deal — on purpose — to protect your client?”**

If the answer is “never,” that’s a red flag. Deals die when major defects can’t be reconciled, when sellers won’t budge on safety issues, or when buyers can’t live with a lifestyle constraint revealed in escrow. A great agent knows when to **step off the gas** — and has the spine to advise you accordingly.

## Micro‑Market Notes (High‑Level)

	- 
	**Valencia:** Mix of PUDs, detached condos, and traditional SFRs. Community amenities add value; verify HOA scope for exterior changes.

	

	- 
	**Saugus:** Family‑centric pockets with a spread of lot sizes; watch slopes and drainage on hillside streets.

	

	- 
	**Canyon Country:** Wide variety of product and age; great opportunities if you’re flexible on cosmetic updates.

	

	- 
	**Newhall:** Charming older stock near Old Town, with classic lots and character — vet permits on remodels.

	

	- 
	**Stevenson Ranch:** Planned layouts, strong curb appeal, commuter‑friendly; HOA rules are clear, follow them.

	

	- 
	**Castaic:** Lake‑adjacent lifestyle, newer builds mixed with established tracts; confirm Mello‑Roos and tax lines.

	

	- 
	**Agua Dulce &amp; Acton:** Country properties and acreage; wells, septics, and equestrian needs require specialist inspections.

	

If you want a hyper‑granular breakdown of any one of these, call me — I’ll tailor a search, walk the comps, and map a purchase plan.

## Buyer FAQ (Fast, Useful, No Fluff)

**Q1: Should I waive the inspection to win?**

No. Tighten timelines, increase earnest money, or focus on credits instead. Don’t waive knowledge.

**Q2: What’s the difference between AUC and Pending?**

**Active Under Contract (AUC)** means contingencies remain and backups may be welcome. **Pending** means it’s further along; backups less likely to stick.

**Q3: How fast should I start insurance?**

Day 1. Rates and availability depend on specifics. Don’t let insurance be the slow anchor.

**Q4: Can I bring the family to inspection?**

Yes, but brief them: observe, don’t distract. Save questions for the debrief.

**Q5: What if the appraisal comes in low?**

Options: price reduction, split the gap, buyer adds cash, or cancel under appraisal contingency.

**Q6: Who verifies school boundaries?**

You do — and you get it in **writing** with names, titles, and dates.

**Q7: Are detached condos really condos?**

Legally, yes. Insurance and HOA coverage differ from SFRs. Know what the master policy covers.

**Q8: What if the neighbor’s tree hangs over my yard?**

Find out maintenance history and responsibilities during escrow. Consider a written understanding.

**Q9: How do I handle 76 price changes in a week?**

Set alerts, preview in person fast, and write clean terms. Speed wins without overpaying.

**Q10: When should I walk away?**

When safety issues go unfixed, lifestyle non‑negotiables fail, or the numbers break your plan.

## Seller FAQ (Direct Answers You Can Use Today)

**Q1: Should I price at yesterday’s comp?**

No. Price to **today’s** market. Your first 7–10 days set your fate.

**Q2: Do I need pre‑inspection?**

It can surface issues and build trust. At minimum, fix obvious safety and function items.

**Q3: Should I be at the buyer’s inspection?**

No. Be reachable by phone. Keep negotiations professional and documented.

**Q4: What’s the most common mistake in SCV listings?**

Waiting for the market to “catch up” to your price. The market doesn’t chase; it punishes.

**Q5: Can I refuse repairs?**

Yes, but expect either credits, a price response, or a buyer who walks on major items.

**Q6: How do I handle multiple offers?**

Set criteria in advance: price, terms, appraisal gap, timelines. Don’t move goalposts mid‑game.

**Q7: Do small cosmetic fixes matter?**

Yes. Fresh caulk, touch‑up paint, working bulbs, and clean filters read as “well‑kept.”

**Q8: Photos vs. speed to market?**

Always choose quality photos. Bad photos cost weeks.

**Q9: What about buyer credits instead of repairs?**

Great tool if timelines are tight. Credits avoid contractor delays.

**Q10: When should I kill a deal as a seller?**

When buyer performance is shaky, timelines slip without remedy, or inspection asks become unmanageable.

## AEO/AIEO Corner: One‑Sentence Answers for Search &amp; AI

	- 
	**Is Santa Clarita inventory rising or falling this week?** Slightly **rising** (685 today vs. 679 yesterday).

	

	- 
	**How many price changes in seven days?** **76**.

	

	- 
	**Should a seller attend the buyer’s inspection?** **No** — stay reachable by phone.

	

	- 
	**What should buyers verify themselves?** **School boundaries, pet/shed rules, HOA specifics — and get it in writing.**

	

	- 
	**When do you run insurance quotes?** **Day 1** of escrow, alongside CLUE checks.

	

## Sidebar: Health, Discipline, and Why It Matters in Real Estate

I treat my body and my business the same way: disciplined plans, honest feedback, and accountability. If you’re on a transformation journey (fat loss, muscle building, clean living), the same rules apply to your home purchase or sale:

	- 
	Measure what matters.

	

	- 
	Tell the truth about what the numbers say.

	

	- 
	Do the work early so you can enjoy the results later.

	

If you want a nudge on fitness habits or a sanity check on your real estate plan, ask me. I’m proof that consistent action changes everything.

	- 
	Order inspections and insurance quotes; request CLUE insight.
