When I have buyers contact me to view home and subsequently make an offer on a home I showed to them, It's a whole process.

I have seen the home - that is a first good second step, I have already done my 1st step, where I have digested the area, the neighborhood, the actual builder who was responsible for the home being built in the first place, the HOA and what they cover and how much and how much can they increase their amounts and how much can they. I have the mello roos taxes, special assessments and other "payees" that a homeowner may not expect, being a first time buyer. Also, there are neighborhoods that have varied historical markers regarding the homes that have been sold there over the years. Such as a home being located in a Fire/Flood/Earthquake zone. Time in the trenches as a local Santa Clarita real estate agent brings things like this to the forefront of my home buyer representative mind when I interact with my home buyers.

Second - as stated, is me seeing the home to see what other things am I able to inform my buyers about. How if the roof, what about the surrounding properties and their potential impact on the home I'm showing the home buyers? Do they have large trees, with large root systems, how does the shared fencing look, what about any overgrowth that may affect my buyers home over time, what do they need to know? Then we have the neighbors, who are they, I set up the buyer presentation if they decide to write the offer, in fact, if we are going to write an offer that day, we need to door knock the neighbors to see who they are and get their intel about the community and neighborhood.

Second - as stated allows me to give you a good offering price and strategy. Now that I have seen the home in person, I have just broken away from the nonsense contained within the syndication websites and what they "think the home value" happens to be. Now, I am able to give my buyers a plan to purchase the home they have just viewed with me.

My plan to purchase may involve a quick call to a roofing contractor if there happens to be an issue with the roof discovered upon our first viewing. While this can be negotiated early and while time is of the essence, the market maybe so hot, we need to write then wait until our inspection process in order to find out more regarding the roof. In a perfect world, we'd try to get answers from the seller about the roof or (insert other thing here) before we write the offer. However, the seller maybe unable to respond by the time they receive an offer from another party who is willing to move forward without any questions being answered at the time before making said offer. Hence, case by case basis is often adhered to by me when developing my Santa Clarita home buyer plan.&nbsp;

These are the basic items for negotiation - and the thought process behind me wanting to be the best agent for you.

Hey there, Santa Clarita! Connor MacIvor here, your trusted real estate advisor at [Santa Clarita Open Houses](/). Welcome back to our daily Market Watch update, where I bring you the freshest insights, straight from the field, that you won’t hear anywhere else. Let's dive into today’s numbers and trends, and discuss what you need to know if you’re thinking about buying, selling, or investing in a home, condo, or townhome in Santa Clarita.

We’ve got some interesting numbers today! Starting with **Coming Soon** listings, we currently have 11 properties in the pipeline. These are not yet on the market but will be soon, providing an excellent opportunity for buyers to get a head start. Moving to **New Listings**, there are 82 fresh properties that have just hit the market, including single-family homes, condos, and townhomes. If you're in the market to buy, these properties offer a wide range of choices, but with competition heating up, you’ll need to act fast!

Next, let’s talk about **Price Changes**. We have 81 properties that have recently had their prices adjusted. This reflects a flexible and evolving market. As a buyer, these price changes could mean a property has just entered your budget. As a seller, it’s crucial to ensure your property is competitively priced right from the start, and I’m here to help you with that strategy.

Now, here’s an interesting one: **Back on Market**. 24 properties have returned to the market after falling out of escrow. This could be due to a variety of reasons, like financing issues or inspections, and it presents a prime opportunity for buyers to grab a home that may have been off the table temporarily.

Looking at **Active Under Contract** properties, there are 35 currently under contract but still accepting backup offers. Buyers, this is your chance to stay in the game by placing a strong backup offer in case the primary deal falls through.

**Pending Sales** are also notable, with 44 properties moving towards closing, showing solid activity and demand in the market. For those tracking market trends, **Closed Sales** are at 55, indicating steady transactions and buyer engagement.

On the flip side, we have **Expired Listings**, which stand at 7. These are properties that did not sell within their listing period. Often, this is due to incorrect pricing or lackluster marketing. Sellers, if your home is stuck on the market, it might be time to rethink your approach. Let’s discuss how I can help you achieve better results.

We also have 16 **Canceled Listings**, where sellers have decided to pull their properties off the market. This can mean several things, but it could signal hidden opportunities for buyers if those sellers decide to re-list. Lastly, 6 **Withdrawn Listings** are properties that have been temporarily removed from the market, often due to changes in circumstances or dissatisfaction with the agent's performance. If you're in this situation, reach out to me, and I’ll provide you with a fresh perspective and a new strategy to get your property sold.

**Total Daily Inventory** for residential properties, including single-family homes, condos, and townhomes, is at 550. This reflects a dynamic market with opportunities for both buyers and sellers.

Now, let’s cover some **Real Estate Insights Other Agents Aren't Talking About**:

**Why the Timing of Listing Matters More Than Ever**: Many agents will tell you to list whenever you're ready, but not all times are equal in real estate. With mortgage rates inching closer to the 'magic number,' more buyers are entering the market. Listing now, before rates potentially drop further, could place you in a position of strength, minimizing your time on the market and maximizing your sale price.

**Off-Market and Pocket Listings**: Many agents won’t mention this, but off-market opportunities can be gold mines for serious buyers and sellers. Whether it’s a property not yet officially listed or a seller considering a private deal, there are always hidden opportunities. At Connor with Honor, I keep a close eye on these deals to help you find them before anyone else.

**The Power of Staging and Digital Curb Appeal**: It’s not just about cleaning up. Today’s buyers are shopping online first, so high-quality photos, virtual tours, and even drone shots are critical. I can connect you with the best resources to make your home shine and attract serious buyers quickly.

**Navigating Buyer and Seller Contingencies Like a Pro**: Contingencies often make or break deals, but with the right negotiation strategies, you can turn them to your advantage. I’ll guide you through which contingencies to keep, which to waive, and how to make your offer—or acceptance—the strongest in today’s market.

**Preparing for a Surge in Market Activity**: Mortgage rates are dropping, and economic indicators are stabilizing, signaling a potential surge in market activity. Sellers, now is the time to prep your home to stand out. Buyers, get pre-approved, have your financials in order, and be ready to act fast.

**Closing Thoughts**: Folks, the Santa Clarita real estate market is moving fast, and being informed is your best asset. As always, I’m here to help you navigate these waters with confidence and clarity. Remember, when it comes to choosing the best agent to sell, list, or help you buy a home, 'Connor with Honor' has got your back.
