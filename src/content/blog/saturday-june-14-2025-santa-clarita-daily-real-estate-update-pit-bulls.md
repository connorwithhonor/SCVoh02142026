# Saturday, June 14, 2025 - Santa Clarita Daily real estate update PIT BULLS

Connor "with Honor" MacIvor - June 14, 2025** [0 Comments](/#comments) | [Add Comment](/#add-comment)

## Santa Clarita Real Estate: Your Definitive Guide to Navigating the Market in 2025

Welcome, friends! This is your comprehensive Santa Clarita Valley Real Estate Update for Friday, June 14, 2024 (with an eye on 2025 trends), brought to you by Connor with Honor. As a former LAPD Motor Cop turned full-time real estate professional, I bring a unique blend of discipline, strategic thinking, and unwavering dedication to every client interaction. My journey, from serving the streets of Los Angeles to guiding you through the complexities of real estate, and even my personal transformation from "fat to fit" has equipped me with an unparalleled commitment to protection and service, especially when it comes to your equity. SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com is not just a website; it's a powerful tool designed to give you a decisive edge in the competitive Southern California housing market.

### The Evolving Landscape of Santa Clarita Real Estate in 2025

The real estate market is ever-changing, and 2025 promises to be a year of dynamic shifts and strategic opportunities in the Santa Clarita Valley. Understanding these underlying currents is paramount for both buyers and sellers to make informed decisions and achieve their real estate goals.

#### Current Market Snapshot: Inventory and Hidden Opportunities

As of June 14, 2024, our market shows **777 active listings**. While this number might seem substantial, it's crucial to understand a vital nuance: this figure *excludes* the "Coming Soon" homes. These are properties that have been entered into the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) but are not yet publicly advertised. Real estate agents have up to 21 days to activate these listings, creating a window of opportunity for informed buyers. If your agent isn't proactively tracking and providing access to these "Coming Soon" properties, you could be missing out on your ideal home before it ever reaches platforms like Zillow or Redfin.

This "hidden inventory" phenomenon is a prime example of why local expertise and direct access to real-time data are invaluable. At SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com, we prioritize tracking these listings daily, ensuring our clients have the earliest possible access to new properties on the market. This proactive approach can be the difference between finding your dream home and watching it go to another buyer who had insider information.

While the overall inventory has seen an increase, it still remains well below historical norms for the Santa Clarita Valley. This ongoing supply-demand imbalance continues to fuel a seller's market, characterized by relatively quick sales. Currently, the average "Days on Market" (DOM) for many homes is quite low, with some properties selling within an impressive 7 to 14 days. This speed underscores the need for buyers to be pre-approved, decisive, and represented by an agent who can act swiftly on their behalf.

#### The Interest Rate Outlook and Its Market Impact

A significant factor shaping the real estate market, now and in 2025, is the movement of interest rates. These rates are primarily influenced by the 10-year bond yield and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. The anticipation of potential reductions in the Fed's interest rates is a major theme driving current buyer activity.

A decrease in the Fed rate could trigger a substantial wave of activity in the housing market, leading to:

	- **Lower Mortgage Rates**: Directly impacting affordability and making homeownership more accessible for a wider range of buyers.

	- **A Refinancing Boom**: Homeowners who purchased during periods of higher rates would likely seize the opportunity to refinance their mortgages, securing lower monthly payments.

	- **Increased Buyer Entry**: Renewed affordability would draw more buyers into the market, intensifying competition.

	- **Further Reduction in Days on Market**: As demand surges, homes would sell even faster, potentially leading to bidding wars and higher sales prices.

It's a delicate balance. While the 10-year bond primarily influences mortgage rates, a decisive move by the Federal Reserve provides a strong signal of confidence in the economy, which in turn can lead to more dramatic reductions in mortgage rates. If this reduction occurs, the currently negotiable market could rapidly transform into an even more competitive arena. For buyers, this means that securing a property now, while there's still some room for negotiation, might be a strategic move. For sellers, it reinforces the importance of proper pricing and presentation to capitalize on increasing buyer enthusiasm.

### Understanding Homeowners Associations (HOAs) in Santa Clarita

A significant portion of Santa Clarita Valley properties are part of Homeowners Associations, particularly in master-planned communities like Valencia. For both buyers and sellers, a thorough understanding of HOA rules and regulations is critical. Before writing an offer, buyers must delve into the fine print, as HOA policies can profoundly impact your daily life and property rights.

Common HOA restrictions to be aware of include:

	- **Pet Policies**: This is a frequent point of contention. HOAs often have limits on the number of pets, size restrictions, or even specific breed prohibitions (e.g., Pit Bulls or German Shepherds). It’s vital to confirm that your beloved furry (or scaly, or feathered) companions are welcome before committing to a purchase.

	- **Property Modifications**: HOAs typically regulate external changes to homes and landscaping. This can include rules on fencing, outdoor structures, paint colors, and even the type of plants you can use in your garden. While these rules aim to maintain community aesthetics and property values, they can limit your personal freedom in customizing your home.

	- **Noise and Nuisance Rules**: Most HOAs have provisions regarding excessive noise, parking, and general conduct to ensure a peaceful living environment for all residents.

	- **Management Structure**: HOAs can be self-managed by residents or overseen by professional management companies. Understanding the management style is important, as it dictates how responsive and flexible the association might be regarding rule interpretations or specific requests. My advice: acquire the HOA's contact information before closing, and don't hesitate to reach out to gauge their responsiveness and "vibe." Some associations are far easier to work with than others.

In California, there's a cultural preference for distinct property boundaries and privacy, often marked by fences. This contrasts with other states where sprawling, unfenced properties are common. It's a key consideration for those relocating, as a lack of fencing can sometimes lead to unexpected interactions with neighbors. The Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&amp;Rs) are the governing documents of an HOA, and they provide the framework for enforcing these rules. If a neighbor violates the CC&amp;Rs, the HOA is the proper authority to address the issue, preventing residents from having to take matters into their own hands. This enforcement mechanism is a significant benefit of living in an HOA-governed community, ensuring consistency and adherence to agreed-upon standards.

### The Unparalleled Advantages of Homeownership

Despite market fluctuations and the nuances of HOAs, the advantages of owning real estate remain compelling and far outweigh the challenges for most individuals and families.

	- **Mortgage Interest Deductions**: For many homeowners, the ability to deduct mortgage interest from their taxable income provides a significant financial benefit, particularly for those in higher tax brackets. It's essentially a federal subsidy for homeownership that can reduce your overall tax burden.

	- **Building Equity**: Every mortgage payment contributes to building equity in your home. This equity is a tangible asset that can be borrowed against, used for future investments, or realized upon sale. Unlike rent, which is a pure expense, mortgage payments are an investment in your financial future.

	- **Stability and Predictability**: Owning a home provides a powerful hedge against rising rental costs. While property taxes and insurance can fluctuate, your fixed-rate mortgage payment remains constant, offering financial stability and predictability in your housing expenses. This stability is particularly valuable in an inflationary environment where rental prices can surge unpredictably.

	- **Personal Freedom and Customization**: Within the bounds of HOA rules, homeownership grants you the freedom to personalize your living space to suit your tastes and needs. Whether it's renovating a kitchen, landscaping your backyard, or simply painting a wall, you have the autonomy to create a home that truly reflects you. This level of personal expression is simply not possible with rental properties.

	- **Wealth Building**: Historically, real estate has proven to be a reliable long-term investment. While market cycles occur, property values generally appreciate over time, contributing significantly to an individual's overall wealth.

	- **Community and Belonging**: Homeownership often fosters a deeper connection to a community. You become more invested in local schools, services, and neighborhood events, contributing to a stronger sense of belonging and civic engagement.

### The Connor with Honor Advantage: More Than Just a Realtor

My commitment to you goes beyond the typical real estate transaction. My 17 years as an LAPD Motor Cop, followed by 5 years as a reserve officer, instilled in me a unique skillset that directly benefits my clients. I retired honorably, though without a pension, which means my full dedication is now to real estate, and to you. I'm not just a Realtor; I'm a First Responder Realtor, committed to protecting and serving your equity with the same vigilance I once applied to public safety.

#### Experience and Negotiation Skills

My background as a police officer honed my negotiation skills, particularly in high-stakes situations. I've been to hostage negotiator school, which means I bring a unique, disciplined approach to every offer and counteroffer, ensuring your best interests are always at the forefront. I understand the importance of getting everything in writing and will ensure all agreements are clear and legally sound. When you hire me, you're not just getting an agent; you're getting a strategic negotiator who knows how to navigate complex situations and secure favorable outcomes. My goal is to ensure you don't fall victim to scams or unfavorable terms when signing real estate documents.

#### Leveraging AI in Real Estate

I am deeply involved in the Artificial Intelligence space (@AIwithHonor), implementing and integrating AI tools into real estate businesses and brokerages. While AI cannot replace the human element of empathy, understanding, and negotiation, it can significantly enhance efficiency, market analysis, and lead generation. I use AI to provide you with cutting-edge insights and streamline the buying and selling process, giving you a competitive edge. However, I firmly believe that AI should be human-initiated and ethically applied. I've even developed "Connor with Honor Laws" for safe and responsible AI implementation, ensuring technology serves humanity, not the other way around.

#### A Holistic Approach: Health and Wealth

My personal journey of losing 135 pounds in 7.5 months through intermittent and longer-term fasting, and starting testosterone therapy (@Homemuscle, @FastingwithHonor), has taught me the power of discipline and strategic planning. This commitment to health and fitness extends to my professional life. I approach your real estate goals with the same focused determination, ensuring that we create a plan of action that is robust, efficient, and tailored to your success. I believe that a healthy mind and body contribute to better decision-making, and I apply that philosophy to guide you through your real estate endeavors.

### Essential Tips for Buyers and Sellers in 2025

#### For Home Buyers:

	- **Get Pre-Approved**: This is your foundational step. A pre-approval letter demonstrates to sellers that you are a serious and qualified buyer, giving you a significant advantage in competitive markets. I can connect you with legitimate lenders to help you get this done efficiently.

	- **Understand "Coming Soon" Listings**: Don't rely solely on public real estate portals. Work with an agent who can provide you with access to "Coming Soon" listings, giving you a head start on new inventory.

	- **Read All Documents Carefully**: As a former police officer, I emphasize the importance of reading and understanding every document before signing. I will guide you through the complexities of the Residential Purchase Agreement and other contracts.

	- **Insist on Inspections**: A thorough home inspection is non-negotiable. It protects you from unforeseen issues and provides leverage for negotiations.

	- **Understand Title Insurance and Escrow**: These are critical components of a smooth transaction. I can explain the functions of escrow and the importance of title insurance in protecting your investment.

	- **Be a Detective**: When buying a home, don't just inspect the property; observe the neighborhood and, if possible, interact with potential neighbors. This can provide invaluable insights into the "vibe" of the community.

#### For Home Sellers:

	- **Strategic Pricing**: Pricing your home correctly from the outset is crucial. Overpricing can lead to your home sitting on the market, requiring price reductions, while underpricing leaves money on the table. I can provide a comprehensive market analysis to determine the optimal price for your property.

	- **Professional Marketing**: Beyond listing on the MLS, your agent should employ a robust marketing plan. This includes professional photography, virtual tours, and leveraging various social media channels. My AI-driven marketing strategies ensure maximum exposure for your home.

	- **Prepare Your Home**: First impressions matter. Consider decluttering, minor repairs, and staging to make your home appealing to a wide range of buyers.

	- **Understand Commissions and Concessions**: With new commission rules, it's vital to have a clear understanding of what you'll pay and how seller concessions can be used strategically to attract buyers. I believe in transparent discussions about compensation and how I provide unmatched value for my services.

	- **Negotiation Strategy**: You need an agent who is a strong negotiator, not just someone who takes orders. My experience in high-pressure situations allows me to confidently navigate offers and counteroffers to secure the best possible deal for you.

	- **Utilize a Local Expert**: While Zillow provides a broad overview, a local real estate professional offers hyper-local market insights, accurate home valuations, and personalized service that large national platforms cannot match. SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com is built on deep local knowledge, ensuring you get the most accurate and relevant information.
