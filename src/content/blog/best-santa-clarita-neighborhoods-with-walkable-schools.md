Best is totally in the eye of the beholder. What I did Is on each search page, you can search by neighborhood.

![](https://idx-acnt-ihouseprd.b-cdn.net/AR1197716/file_manager/Valencia%20CA%20Santa%20Clarita%20Valley%20Paseo%20Map%20northbridge%20and%20northpark.png?width=500&amp;height=606&amp;aspect_ratio=500%3A606)Understand that the Santa Clarita Valley has a paseo system. In Valencia there seems to be more Paseo access in the areas of Northpark - North of Decoro with McBean Parkway cutting this areas in half. South of Decoro and North of Newhall Ranch Road - you have the area of Northbridge. Within these areas there are several elementary schools and of course - Valencia High School is a bit to the west of Decoro and McBean, on the other side of the "wash". (the wash, I'm from New Mexico, we'd call that an arroyo. This is the place where the rain water goes and drains from the SCV areas) On either side of this are paseo's - FYI.

If you happen to have me sell you a home in one of these areas, most are within waking distance to schools, depending if that is your thing.

I will explain to you that if you are buying a home in the Santa Clarita Valley dependent on the school that your kids will be attending, you need to make sure you are within the correct boundary.

I advise my clients not to take the mapping or school district map as the word of God but to make a phone call to the school and then follow up that call with an email to the person who disseminated the information.

You will call to find out if the home at "12345 Cross and Don't Cross Road" is within the boundary for, let's say, "Bridgeport Elementary" school. If the voice on the other end of the line gives you the green light, then get that person's email address and follow up with them in an email such as this.

"*Subject* - Bridgeport Elementary School access map. *Body* - Dear Frankie, thanks for your time on the phone today. I called about the home that I'm considering making an offer on located at "***12345 Cross and Don't Cross Road, Valencia CA, 91355 ***is within the boundary for my kids to attend Bridgeport elementary this coming spring/fall - then insert the year. Sincerely yours, Diego Mantra. P.S. Please let me know if I understood you correctly."

That has worked and saved my clients a lot of heartache. Sometimes, you will find school boundary information online within the various home sales systems - like the mega syndication websites, which cannot compete with my Local "Boots on the ground" website at SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com . They don't purposely display inaccurate information, for the most part, unless it's determined they have some "interest" in their showing you the wrong information in order to solicit a response that will benefit them.

Here is something that you need to know. IN ALL cases, you want to call the local law enforcement agency and talk about where you are buying a home and then ask what the deputy, office, or "law enforcement officer" can tell you about child safety and what they think if they'd consider letting&nbsp;their child walk to school, living in the area you are considering.

They are not going to be able to tell you with 100% certainty that all will be okay, and you may not even care about their ability to love their children to the level you are able, but asking may give you insight you did not have prior to the question being posed.

Another essential idea would be to call the school and see what the percentage of children who walk to school is. Again, you will not be able to stop all the bad in the world, but you may hear something that you have not considered, and that is power.&nbsp;

In all cases, when you are considering a move for your children's sake, you need to get the email addresses and names of who you talk with. That way you can follow up properly to ensure you understood what you were told correctly.

Can your real estate agent run all of this for you? Sure, but I'd just throw caution to the wind about that. Your real estate agent has a vested interest in your buying a home. The sheriff's deputy that you get on the phone that you ask about crime, walking to school safety, etc. - they don't get more pay for a positive versus negative answer - they are a non-interested party. Therefore, their word should be paramount.

It would be best if you also did the contacting. If you leave this to your agent, they may get the person on the phone during their last day, and that person is angry at the system and not be thinking clearly, and will say anything to get you off of the phone. Hence the follow being very important and you doing these parts personally within&nbsp;the home buying process.

There are also different systems in place that give "grades" on the school's performance based on various factors. Look at the "verification and data" sources for the information you are consuming. This is based on my own real estate experience before the internet was more than a 56.6K dial-up system. (remember AOL)

Some will have a great review by one person that will send the school to the top of the "best of Santa Clarita schools" list. This is bad data and the sample size is way too small to give the better data. If you have any questions about buying a home within certain school boundaries in the Santa Clarita Valley, I have you covered. I can give you that data, but I will also make mandatory for my clients to make their own follow up calls in order to self-validate any and all information I give them.&nbsp;

That leaves up with this topic covered and updated as of August 24, 2024. I'm Connor with Honor, when you are ready, you can read more about my "value proposition" for home buyers in the Santa Clarita Valley.
