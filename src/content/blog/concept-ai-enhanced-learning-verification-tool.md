However, I have a very diverse background.** I taught new cops, old cops, and cops in between. I was blessed to instruct officers from Canada, the RCMP, and the NYPD, along with others from all over the country when I was a Drug Recognition Expert Instructor. I know cops, and cops are the same all over. It’s a strange fraternity of diverse people with a shared commonality: a willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice for people they don’t know.

For most people, this is so foreign that it’s light years from their line of thought. But when they need someone in that line of work, they are thankful—if, of course, they are dealing with a "true convert" of a professional Law Enforcement Officer (LEO).

**Reflecting on the Evolution of Learning**

When I was a kid, copying someone else’s work wasn’t easy. If you did, you usually paid another student to do it for you. To copy from an encyclopedia or a book you found in the library meant getting caught—teachers could sniff it out. They knew us, our limitations, and when we’d produced work "above our pay grade." Questions would follow, and most would end up coming clean about a bit of "cheating."

**Artificial Intelligence—or perhaps "Alien Intelligence"**

Artificial intelligence—maybe better described as "alien intelligence." I heard this term a while back, and it resonates with me. It’s more than just something fake or made-up. Remember, the developers have built something smarter than any human being. For now, as of November 5, 2024, it’s not self-aware—or at least, that’s what I’ve heard. But there may be something on the horizon about true consciousness. When AI reaches that level, "artificial" becomes something that grows, learns, and improves by itself.

Experts admit that we don’t fully understand why AI does certain things to find answers to our inquiries. But it achieves "beyond human" results, sometimes even while hallucinating.

**An Inquiry into the Origins of "Alien Intelligence" in AI**

I asked ChatGPT 4.0 who first used "alien intelligence" to describe artificial intelligence, and here’s the response:

The term "alien intelligence" in the context of artificial intelligence is attributed to early thinkers in cybernetics and AI, particularly those who explored the non-human nature of machine intelligence. While no single person is credited with using "alien intelligence" first, a few notable figures laid the groundwork:

**AI in Education: Embrace or Fear?**

I think it’s fantastic that students can use AI. Our teachers are adaptable and resilient, like those of my generation facing calculators in classrooms. Knowing basic math skills like making change is useful, but cash is less common today. Have you ever seen a young person count change accurately without the register’s help? It can be a struggle.

Using AI to complete assignments isn’t a sin; it’s just a mechanism needing verification. When I asked ChatGPT 4.0 about the origins of "alien intelligence," I read and understood everything before pasting it here. Students need to do the same—read, understand, and verify before submitting AI-assisted content. If they do, learning has happened. But if they skip learning, verification, and truth-seeking, they deserve an F. Simple, right?

**A Tool for Teachers in the Age of AI**

To support this, I imagine a tool for teachers, where they can upload a student’s work to ChatGPT for a "learning assessment." Here’s how it could work:

**The Future of AI and Education**

For some, especially those of us in our 50s, adapting to this shift may come with resistance. But we stand on the edge of something extraordinary—or possibly the most significant decision humanity has made. AI is here, and regulation may be slim at best.

**What do you think? Will AI ruin us or save us? Do we need saving?**
