#### **Hello, Santa Clarita Valley!**

It's Connor with Honor here, your First Responder Realtor, ready to guide you through this week’s dynamic real estate market. Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or simply stay informed, understanding what’s happening in the Santa Clarita Valley (SCV) is essential for making confident, smart decisions.

This past week, we’ve seen activity in every corner of SCV—from the family-friendly streets of Valencia and Saugus to the rural landscapes of Acton and Agua Dulce. Let’s break down the numbers, analyze what they mean for buyers and sellers, and share actionable tips to keep you ahead of the curve.

### **Market Snapshot: What’s Happening Across Santa Clarita Valley**

Here’s a look at the latest real estate activity for all cities in the Santa Clarita Valley:

### **What the Numbers Tell Us**

#### **1. New Listings (51)**

Buyers, this is your chance to explore fresh inventory across all price ranges and property types. While inventory typically slows during the holidays, these 51 new listings represent motivated sellers eager to close deals before year-end.

#### **2. Price Changes (56)**

Over 50 price adjustments signal that sellers are meeting the market where it’s at. For buyers, this means more negotiating power—don’t hesitate to make offers, even if they’re below asking price. Sellers, this is a reminder to price competitively to avoid lingering on the market.

#### **3. Back on Market (15)**

Deals falling through can be frustrating for sellers but present great opportunities for buyers. These homes are back in play, often with motivated sellers ready to negotiate.

#### **4. Pending Sales (37) &amp; Active Under Contract (26)**

A total of 63 properties are in escrow or about to close, proving that serious buyers are still making strong offers despite higher interest rates.

#### **5. Closed Sales (66)**

The 66 finalized transactions highlight the ongoing vibrancy of the SCV market. Homes are selling, deals are being made, and there’s still plenty of activity as we approach the new year.

### **Acton and Agua Dulce: A Closer Look**

For those seeking rural charm, larger lots, and a slower pace of life, Acton and Agua Dulce remain standout markets. Here’s what’s happening in these communities over the past 7 days:

**Key Insight:**&nbsp;While activity here is lower than urban areas like Valencia or Saugus, the&nbsp;**5 closed sales**&nbsp;reflect ongoing demand for the privacy and space these communities offer.

**Pro Tip for Buyers in Acton &amp; Agua Dulce:**

If you’re considering rural properties, make sure to investigate water access, septic systems, and zoning. These areas are perfect for buyers looking for equestrian properties or homes with acreage, but rural living comes with unique considerations.
