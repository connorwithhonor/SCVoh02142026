#### **Hello, Santa Clarita Valley!**

It's Connor with Honor here, your First Responder Realtor, ready to guide you through this week’s dynamic real estate market. Whether you’re looking to buy, sell, or simply stay informed, understanding what’s happening in the Santa Clarita Valley (SCV) is essential for making confident, smart decisions.

This past week, we’ve seen activity in every corner of SCV—from the family-friendly streets of Valencia and Saugus to the rural landscapes of Acton and Agua Dulce. Let’s break down the numbers, analyze what they mean for buyers and sellers, and share actionable tips to keep you ahead of the curve.

### **Market Snapshot: What’s Happening Across Santa Clarita Valley**

Here’s a look at the latest real estate activity for all cities in the Santa Clarita Valley:

	- **Coming Soon Listings:**&nbsp;4

	- **New Listings:**&nbsp;51

	- **Price Changes:**&nbsp;56

	- **Back on Market:**&nbsp;15

	- **Active Under Contract:**&nbsp;26

	- **Pending Sales:**&nbsp;37

	- **Closed Sales:**&nbsp;66

	- **Expired Listings:**&nbsp;8

	- **Canceled Listings:**&nbsp;11

	- **Hold Listings:**&nbsp;14

	- **Withdrawn Listings:**&nbsp;7

### **What the Numbers Tell Us**

#### **1. New Listings (51)**

Buyers, this is your chance to explore fresh inventory across all price ranges and property types. While inventory typically slows during the holidays, these 51 new listings represent motivated sellers eager to close deals before year-end.

#### **2. Price Changes (56)**

Over 50 price adjustments signal that sellers are meeting the market where it’s at. For buyers, this means more negotiating power—don’t hesitate to make offers, even if they’re below asking price. Sellers, this is a reminder to price competitively to avoid lingering on the market.

#### **3. Back on Market (15)**

Deals falling through can be frustrating for sellers but present great opportunities for buyers. These homes are back in play, often with motivated sellers ready to negotiate.

#### **4. Pending Sales (37) &amp; Active Under Contract (26)**

A total of 63 properties are in escrow or about to close, proving that serious buyers are still making strong offers despite higher interest rates.

#### **5. Closed Sales (66)**

The 66 finalized transactions highlight the ongoing vibrancy of the SCV market. Homes are selling, deals are being made, and there’s still plenty of activity as we approach the new year.

### **Acton and Agua Dulce: A Closer Look**

For those seeking rural charm, larger lots, and a slower pace of life, Acton and Agua Dulce remain standout markets. Here’s what’s happening in these communities over the past 7 days:

	- **Coming Soon Listings:**&nbsp;1

	- **New Listings:**&nbsp;1

	- **Price Changes:**&nbsp;0

	- **Back on Market:**&nbsp;0

	- **Active Under Contract:**&nbsp;0

	- **Pending Sales:**&nbsp;2

	- **Closed Sales:**&nbsp;5

	- **Hold Listings:**&nbsp;2

	- **Expired/Canceled/Withdrawn Listings:**&nbsp;0

**Key Insight:**&nbsp;While activity here is lower than urban areas like Valencia or Saugus, the&nbsp;**5 closed sales**&nbsp;reflect ongoing demand for the privacy and space these communities offer.

**Pro Tip for Buyers in Acton &amp; Agua Dulce:**

If you’re considering rural properties, make sure to investigate water access, septic systems, and zoning. These areas are perfect for buyers looking for equestrian properties or homes with acreage, but rural living comes with unique considerations.

### **City-by-City Breakdown of Trends**

#### **1. Valencia**

	- Known for its master-planned communities, Valencia offers excellent schools, parks, and a family-friendly vibe. With multiple price changes this week, buyers have opportunities to secure deals in one of SCV’s most desirable locations.

#### **2. Stevenson Ranch**

	- A favorite for luxury seekers, Stevenson Ranch is known for larger homes and scenic views. Sellers here should focus on strategic pricing and high-quality staging to attract discerning buyers.

#### **3. Saugus**

	- A balanced market with affordable options for first-time buyers and growing families. Saugus offers a mix of suburban convenience and top-notch schools.

#### **4. Canyon Country**

	- Known for affordability and variety, Canyon Country remains a hotspot for value-conscious buyers. Price adjustments this week make it even more appealing.

#### **5. Newhall**

	- A historic gem, Newhall is seeing renewed interest thanks to its revitalized downtown and investment opportunities. Inventory tends to move quickly, so buyers should act fast.

#### **6. Castaic**

	- With its proximity to Castaic Lake, this area is ideal for outdoor enthusiasts and those looking for a quieter lifestyle. Limited inventory requires buyers to be proactive.

#### **7. Acton &amp; Agua Dulce**

	- Perfect for buyers seeking space, privacy, and rural charm. Recent sales activity shows consistent demand for these unique communities.

### **Actionable Tips for Buyers**

	- 
	**Negotiate Wisely:**&nbsp;With 56 price adjustments this week, sellers are showing flexibility. Don’t be afraid to make an offer below asking, but keep it reasonable to avoid offending the seller.

	

	- 
	**Get Pre-Approved:**&nbsp;A pre-approval letter is your ticket to the front of the line. Sellers take serious buyers seriously, and having financing ready makes your offer more attractive.

	

	- 
	**Thorough Inspections Are Key:**&nbsp;Never skip a home inspection, even for newer properties. This step is critical to avoiding costly surprises later.

	

### **Actionable Tips for Sellers**

	- 
	**Price It Right:**&nbsp;Overpricing is a surefire way to end up in the “Expired” or “Canceled” category. Price competitively from the start to attract serious buyers.

	

	- 
	**Stage Strategically:**&nbsp;Highlight your home’s best features. Neutral holiday décor can add warmth without being distracting.

	

	- 
	**Be Flexible:**&nbsp;With 15 homes returning to the market, it’s clear that deals can fall apart. Be prepared to negotiate during escrow to keep the deal alive.
