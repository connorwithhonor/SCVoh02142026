**Day 324 of 2024 | Week 47**

Welcome to today’s **Stevenson Ranch Real Estate Market Update**, brought to you by me, Connor MacIvor—*Connor with Honor*, your trusted **First Responder Realtor**. Whether you're here for real estate, fitness, or both, you’re in the right place. Today, we’ll cover **the current Stevenson Ranch real estate trends**, highlight price changes and their stories, and discuss why selling your home is easier than it’s made out to be—*if done right*.

Let’s get started!

### **Stevenson Ranch: A Market Snapshot**

Here’s a breakdown of activity in **Stevenson Ranch** over the past 7 days:

### **Price Changes: The Stories Behind the Numbers**

The **five price adjustments** this week reveal trends worth examining:

#### **26039 Sandburg Pl**

#### **25820 Tennyson Ln**

#### **25520 Wilde Ave**

#### **24921 Greensbrier Dr**

#### **25737 Perlman Pl #D**

### **What Can We Learn from These Price Adjustments?**

### **Is Selling Your Home Really That Hard?**

Let’s be honest—selling a home isn’t as difficult as some companies make it sound. Here’s why:

#### **You Only Need Two Tools:**

That’s it. With modern technology, selling your home can be seamless. A skilled agent like me handles the rest, from marketing and scheduling showings to negotiating offers and managing paperwork.

#### **The Inconvenience Myth**

Some companies claim selling is inconvenient, but what’s really inconvenient?

The so-called “easy selling programs” offer to buy your home outright, sight unseen. Sounds simple, right? But here’s the catch:

Wouldn’t you rather keep that profit?

### **Real Estate vs. Fitness: Why Are the Narratives Opposite?**

#### **Fat Loss Is Hard; Real Estate Is Easy**

As someone who torched **135 pounds of fat** in 8 months, I can tell you: **losing weight is hard.** It takes discipline, effort, and time. Yet fitness marketing makes it sound easy.

On the flip side, **selling real estate is easier than ever**—especially in today’s tech-driven world. So why do companies make it sound so hard?

Because they want to sell you **convenience**, often at a significant cost to your bottom line.

### **What’s Really Happening in Stevenson Ranch?**

#### **Low Inventory**

Stevenson Ranch has had **no new listings in the past 7 days**. This tight inventory means homes are selling at a premium—but only if they’re priced and marketed correctly.

#### **Fast Sales**

Closed sales this week had an average DOM of just **14 days**. Homes priced appropriately and marketed effectively are flying off the market.

### **Tips for Sellers in Stevenson Ranch**

### **A Quick Word About My Book**

If you’re considering buying or selling, check out my newly updated **2025 edition** of *"The Guide to Buying and Selling Santa Clarita Real Estate."*

### **Closing Thoughts**

Selling real estate isn’t rocket science, and it’s not as hard as some would have you believe. Whether you're in **Stevenson Ranch** or anywhere in **Santa Clarita**, the keys to success are **pricing, strategy, and the right guidance.**

Need help? Call me, Connor MacIvor—your **First Responder Realtor**. Let’s make your real estate journey simple, profitable, and stress-free.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
