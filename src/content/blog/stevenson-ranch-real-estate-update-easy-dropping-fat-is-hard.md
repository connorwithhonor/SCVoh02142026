**Day 324 of 2024 | Week 47**

Welcome to today’s **Stevenson Ranch Real Estate Market Update**, brought to you by me, Connor MacIvor—*Connor with Honor*, your trusted **First Responder Realtor**. Whether you're here for real estate, fitness, or both, you’re in the right place. Today, we’ll cover **the current Stevenson Ranch real estate trends**, highlight price changes and their stories, and discuss why selling your home is easier than it’s made out to be—*if done right*.

Let’s get started!

### **Stevenson Ranch: A Market Snapshot**

Here’s a breakdown of activity in **Stevenson Ranch** over the past 7 days:

	- **Coming Soon Listings:** 1

	- **New Listings:** 0

	- **Price Changes:** 5 (4 reductions, 1 increase)

	- **Back on Market:** 0

	- **Active Under Contract:** 3

	- **Pending Sales:** 1

	- **Closed Sales:** 3

	- **Expired Listings:** 1

	- **Canceled Listings:** 2

	- **Hold/Withdrawn:** 0

### **Price Changes: The Stories Behind the Numbers**

The **five price adjustments** this week reveal trends worth examining:

#### **26039 Sandburg Pl**

	- **Price Drop:** $1,101,000 → $1,099,000

	- **Days on Market:** 18

	This slight adjustment moves the home into a new **search bracket**, targeting buyers with a **sub-$1M budget**. Small price shifts like this are strategic, ensuring the property appears in more searches without significantly affecting the seller's bottom line.

#### **25820 Tennyson Ln**

	- **Price Drop:** $1,499,000 → $1,449,000

	- **Days on Market:** 66

	A $50,000 reduction suggests the seller aimed too high initially. After two months on the market, they’re now aligning with **buyer expectations**, increasing the likelihood of a quicker sale.

#### **25520 Wilde Ave**

	- **Price Drop:** $1,349,000 → $1,339,000

	- **Days on Market:** 75

	This $10,000 adjustment is subtle but indicates the seller is serious about moving the property. They’re likely responding to feedback from showings or market trends.

#### **24921 Greensbrier Dr**

	- **Price Drop:** $1,849,000 → $1,839,000

	- **Days on Market:** 102

	Homes lingering on the market for over 90 days often face challenges in attracting serious buyers. This reduction may not be enough to re-energize interest—it’s time for a **bolder strategy**.

#### **25737 Perlman Pl #D**

	- **Price Increase:** $635,000 → $640,000

	- **Days on Market:** 61

	An unusual upward adjustment suggests heightened interest or multiple offers. The seller might be testing demand, but buyers often respond better to price decreases than increases.

### **What Can We Learn from These Price Adjustments?**

	- **Days on Market (DOM) Matters:** Homes sitting for over 60 days often require pricing adjustments or improved marketing strategies.

	- **Strategic Pricing Is Key:** Small reductions can open a property to a broader audience.

	- **Market Activity Varies:** Even in a tight inventory market like Stevenson Ranch, overpriced homes stall while correctly priced homes move quickly.

### **Is Selling Your Home Really That Hard?**

Let’s be honest—selling a home isn’t as difficult as some companies make it sound. Here’s why:

#### **You Only Need Two Tools:**

	- **Text Messaging**

	- **Email**

That’s it. With modern technology, selling your home can be seamless. A skilled agent like me handles the rest, from marketing and scheduling showings to negotiating offers and managing paperwork.

#### **The Inconvenience Myth**

Some companies claim selling is inconvenient, but what’s really inconvenient?

	- **Allowing buyers to view your home?** Slightly.

	- **Leaving $50,000 or more on the table?** Much more inconvenient.

The so-called “easy selling programs” offer to buy your home outright, sight unseen. Sounds simple, right? But here’s the catch:

	- They’ll **resell your home** to the open market—the same process they claimed was “too difficult.”

	- They’ll **profit from the difference**, often tens of thousands of dollars.

Wouldn’t you rather keep that profit?

### **Real Estate vs. Fitness: Why Are the Narratives Opposite?**

#### **Fat Loss Is Hard; Real Estate Is Easy**

As someone who torched **135 pounds of fat** in 8 months, I can tell you: **losing weight is hard.** It takes discipline, effort, and time. Yet fitness marketing makes it sound easy.

On the flip side, **selling real estate is easier than ever**—especially in today’s tech-driven world. So why do companies make it sound so hard?

Because they want to sell you **convenience**, often at a significant cost to your bottom line.

### **What’s Really Happening in Stevenson Ranch?**

#### **Low Inventory**

Stevenson Ranch has had **no new listings in the past 7 days**. This tight inventory means homes are selling at a premium—but only if they’re priced and marketed correctly.

#### **Fast Sales**

Closed sales this week had an average DOM of just **14 days**. Homes priced appropriately and marketed effectively are flying off the market.

### **Tips for Sellers in Stevenson Ranch**

	- **Price Your Home Right from the Start**

	
		Overpricing leads to stagnation. Use local data to set a competitive price.

	

	
	- **Work with an Experienced Agent**
	
		An agent who understands Stevenson Ranch ensures your home reaches the **entire buying world.**

	

	
	- **Market Aggressively**
	
		Professional photos, virtual tours, and online exposure are non-negotiable.
