**From Fat to Fit: My Journey Through Fasting, Muscle Building, and Longevity**

Welcome to **Connor with Honor**! If you're ready to transform your life, break free from unhealthy habits, and achieve lasting fitness, you're in the right place. Join me as I share my unfiltered, honest journey from battling a 65" waist and weighing 365 pounds to becoming a healthier, leaner, and stronger version of myself. In this comprehensive video, I delve deep into the strategies that helped me torch 135 pounds of stubborn fat, conquer impulsive eating, and adopt a sustainable lifestyle centered around fasting, intelligent nutrition, and effective resistance training.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
