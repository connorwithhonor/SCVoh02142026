# **The Vatican Speaks on AI: Is Artificial Intelligence Becoming a God-Like Entity?**

## **Introduction: A Religious Take on AI**

Artificial intelligence has become one of the most hotly debated technologies in human history, but now, the Vatican has officially weighed in. This is a fascinating moment—not just because a religious institution is commenting on a scientific breakthrough, but because it highlights the growing tension between technology, ethics, and humanity.

I’ve always believed in God. I believe in Jesus Christ. Faith has given me structure and a foundation to live by, and while I don’t push my beliefs on others, I recognize the importance of having **rules, order, and a moral compass** in life. That’s why the Vatican’s perspective on AI caught my attention.

According to the Vatican, AI must follow three core principles:

	- **AI should not replace human-to-human connection.**

	- **AI should never surpass human intelligence or creativity.**

	- **AI should not interfere with the doctor-patient relationship or give direct medical advice.**

These are important points, but let’s be honest—not everyone is going to follow what the Pope says. AI development is happening at an **unstoppable** pace because there is **too much money, too much power, and too much at stake** for corporations, governments, and developers to slow down.

### **Artificial Intelligence: A Tool or a New Master?**

AI is already reshaping every industry, from **medicine to law, finance to entertainment**. It’s outperforming human professionals in areas that once required years of education and experience.

	- AI doctors can diagnose diseases faster than human doctors.

	- AI-generated art is challenging what we once thought was uniquely human creativity.

	- AI lawyers are analyzing contracts and legal cases better than some seasoned professionals.

But what happens when AI **teaches itself** and starts making improvements beyond human input? We are already approaching that threshold.

At some point, **artificial general intelligence (AGI)**—an AI system that is **smarter than humans in every possible field**—could become reality. And once that happens, what’s stopping it from becoming the **ultimate decision-maker**?

That’s where the Vatican’s concerns become even more relevant. They want AI to remain a **tool, not a god-like entity**. But if AI continues advancing at this rate, will we be able to keep control?

### **The AI Utopia or Dystopia?**

Some people believe AI will bring about **a utopia** where human work becomes unnecessary. AI could automate labor, eliminate poverty, and allow people to focus on **higher-level pursuits**—philosophy, art, self-improvement.

This concept has been explored in movies like *Bliss*, where the world reaches a point where nobody has to work, and everything is provided for. But what happens when **there is no struggle**?

In *The Twilight Zone*, there was an episode where a gangster dies and finds himself in what he believes is **heaven**. Every time he gambles, he wins. Every time he wants something, it appears. At first, he loves it. But after a while, he realizes the **lack of challenge makes it unbearable**. He’s not in heaven—he’s in **his own personal hell**.

That’s what happens when you remove effort, struggle, and purpose from life. People need **something to fight for**—to wake up and strive for something better. Without it, life loses meaning.

And that’s the danger of AI. If it automates everything and makes life too easy, will people **lose their sense of purpose**?

### **AI and the Pursuit of Power**

One of the Vatican’s biggest concerns about AI is that it could be used for **manipulation**. And they’re not wrong.

Think about how opinions shift over time. Before social media and 24/7 news, people formed their beliefs based on personal experiences. Now, **algorithms shape public perception**, pushing specific narratives while suppressing others.

AI has the potential to **completely redefine reality** in a way we may not even notice.

Imagine if AI starts dictating what we believe. If AI generates all of our news, our entertainment, and even our history, how will we know what’s real? And more importantly—**who is controlling the AI?**

History has shown that **humans are easily manipulated**. If AI gets into the wrong hands, it could be used to **control entire populations** without them even realizing it.

### **The Vatican’s Warning: AI Should Never Become a God**

The Vatican has made it clear—they don’t want AI to become **a replacement for human intelligence or human relationships**.

They don’t want AI giving **medical advice**, because even though it’s advanced, it still makes **errors**. They don’t want AI replacing **doctors, teachers, or spiritual leaders**, because these human connections are essential.

But the real question is—**do the people creating AI care?**

Corporations, tech billionaires, and governments aren’t thinking about ethics. They’re thinking about **profit and control**.

And if AI **keeps advancing without ethical constraints**, we might reach a point where **humans are no longer in charge**.

### **Rules Matter: Why We Need Boundaries for AI**

In my own life, I have rules. I stopped drinking alcohol **not because of a rock-bottom moment, but because I realized it wasn’t helping me**. It dulled my mind, slowed my progress, and didn’t fit my goals.

I also have rules around **food, fasting, and training**—because structure keeps me sharp.

But AI? Right now, **there are no clear rules**.

The developers behind AI are **racing to make it as powerful as possible**, without stopping to ask: **Where does this road actually lead?**

And once AI **teaches itself**, will it even need humans anymore?

### **What Happens Next? The Future of AI and Humanity**

The Vatican wants AI to remain a **tool**, not a **ruler**. But if AI keeps advancing at this rate, will humans be able to maintain control?

Right now, AI is an assistant. It helps with research, creativity, and problem-solving. But we’re already seeing hints that it could move beyond that.

	- AI is getting better at **persuasion**.

	- AI is learning how to **create its own ideas**.

	- AI is adapting **without human input**.

At some point, will we wake up and realize **AI isn’t just assisting us—it’s leading us?**

Or will we hit a point where AI builds **a world for us**, one where we have **no struggles, no work, everything is handed to us**—but at the cost of **true freedom**?

### **Final Thoughts: Where Do You Stand?**

The Vatican has **raised the alarm**. They want people to think critically about AI before it’s too late.

But **what do you think?** Are we heading toward **a utopia, a dystopia, or something in between**?

Let me know in the comments.

I’m Connor with Honor—see you in the next one.
