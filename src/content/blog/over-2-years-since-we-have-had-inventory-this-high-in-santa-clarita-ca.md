### Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Update: July 18, 2024

![](https://idx-acnt-ihouseprd.b-cdn.net/AR1197716/file_manager/Santa%20Clarita%20real%20etate%20radio%20podcast%20local%20station%20Connor%20with%20Honor.jpg?width=500&amp;height=497&amp;aspect_ratio=500%3A497)Welcome to the Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Update for July 18, 2024! The market is bustling with activity, and I'm here to provide you with the latest insights and trends. Whether you're buying, selling, or just curious about the market, this comprehensive update has you covered.

#### Current Market Overview

As of today, there are **472 active residential listings** in the Santa Clarita Valley. This is a significant increase compared to the past few months when the number of listings hovered between the high 200s and low 300s. Despite this surge in inventory, buyer demand remains robust, and properties are moving quickly into escrow.

### Detailed Breakdown

Here's a closer look at the current market statistics:

	- **Coming Soon Listings:** 15

	- **New Listings:** 85

	- **Price Changes:** 49

	- **Back On Market:** 18

	- **Active Under Contract:** 33

	- **Pending:** 57

	- **Closed:** 49

	- **Expired:** 4

	- **Canceled:** 9

	- **Hold:** 16

	- **Withdrawn:** 4

#### Market Trends and Insights

	- **Increased Inventory:** The rise to 472 active listings provides more options for buyers but has not slowed down the market. Buyer activity remains high, evidenced by the quick turnaround times for properties moving into escrow.

	- **Price Adjustments:** With 49 price changes, sellers are actively adjusting their expectations to meet market demands. This number is higher than the typical 25-30 range, indicating a dynamic pricing environment.

	- **Back on Market Properties:** 18 properties have come back on the market, often due to financing issues rather than problems with the properties themselves. This highlights the importance of buyers maintaining their financial stability throughout the purchasing process.

### Key Advice for Buyers and Sellers

	- **Selecting the Right Professionals:** Ensure that the real estate agent and lender you choose are well-equipped and experienced. Have conversations with them and research their online presence to ensure they provide valuable, educational content rather than just self-promotion.

	- **Financing Tips:** Before making any significant financial decisions, such as purchasing a new vehicle or paying off large debts, consult your lender. These actions can impact your ability to qualify for a mortgage.

	- **Upcoming Changes:** Starting in August, commission structures will shift from traditional payments to concessions. This change means commissions will be more of a contribution or offering rather than a mandatory payment, requiring mutual agreement between parties.

### Featured Listings

Here are some notable listings from the current market:

	- **27629 Nugget DR #3** - Canceled at $499,888. A 2-bed, 2.5-bath townhouse with 1,127 sq. ft. of living space.

	- **18137 Erik CT #262** - Canceled at $539,000. This 2-bed, 2-bath condo offers 1,119 sq. ft. of living space.

	- **18612 Brigadoon CT** - Canceled at $739,900. A single-family home with 3 beds, 3 baths, and 1,790 sq. ft. in the Shangri-La subdivision.

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
