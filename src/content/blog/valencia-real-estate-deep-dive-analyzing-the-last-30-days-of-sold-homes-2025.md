Hey everyone, Connor MacIvor here – your dedicated [First Responder Realtor®](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-working-with-a-first-responder-turned-realtor-gives-you-the-edge) serving the [Santa Clarita Valley](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-homes) and greater Southern California. You might know me from my website, [SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/), my social channels like @FirstResponderRealtor, or perhaps my work integrating cutting-edge tech through @AIwithHonor. Today, we're bypassing the headlines and digging straight into the most crucial data for anyone involved in [Valencia real estate](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/valencia-homes): the *actual closed sales*.

Why focus on solds? Because while active listings show *intent*, sold data reveals *reality*. It tells us what buyers are truly paying, how long homes are *really* taking to sell, and the negotiation points, like seller concessions, that are shaping deals right now. This analysis covers every home, condo, and townhome reported sold in Valencia during the approximately 30-day window ending March 26, 2025, based on detailed listing data provided. Whether you're preparing for [selling your Santa Clarita home](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/sellers-guide) or embarking on your [home buying journey](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/buyers-guide), this information is gold.

**Disclaimer:** This analysis is based *exclusively* on a specific dataset of 36 closed sales provided for this period. The [Santa Clarita real estate market trends](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-real-estate-market-trends) are constantly evolving. Think of this as a high-resolution snapshot in time, offering valuable context but always best combined with up-to-the-minute insights – something I specialize in providing.

Let's dive into the findings.
