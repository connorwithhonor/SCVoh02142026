# Santa Clarita Residential Market Update: Basic Market Statistics

*By your trusted real‐estate guide, here to help you navigate the market with clarity and wisdom.*

## Introduction

When it comes to real estate, knowledge is power. As you know, the Santa Clarita Valley is a diverse market with properties ranging from modest starter homes to luxurious estates. Today, we’re going to look at the overall basic market statistics for residential properties meeting our criteria. In other words, we’ll see the market “as a whole” by looking at averages, minimums, maximums, medians, and sums across several statuses—including “Coming Soon,” “Active,” “Active Under Contract,” “Pending,” “Closed,” “Expired,” “Canceled,” “Hold,” and “Withdrawn.” Whether you’re a first‑time buyer, a seasoned seller, or an investor planning your next move, these numbers will provide a factual basis for making informed decisions.

## What Do the Numbers Tell Us?

Let’s break down the major data points that paint the overall picture of the market.

### 1. Pricing – From Entry Level to High-End

**List Price Overview:**

**Takeaway:**

The wide range in list prices—from about $150K to over $5M—demonstrates the market’s diversity. Whether you’re looking for a starter home or a luxury property, there’s a place for you here.

### 2. Market Velocity – How Fast Are Homes Selling?

**Active Days on Market (ADOM):**

### 3. Sale Price to List Price Ratio (SP/LP %)

One of the most telling metrics is the ratio of the sale (close) price to the list price. Here’s what we see across the board:

**Interpreting the Data:**

**What It Means for You:**

For sellers, this is great news—it means that if you price your home appropriately, you’re likely to receive offers at or near your asking price. Buyers should be aware that in competitive segments, you may have to meet the asking price (or even exceed it) to secure your dream home.

### 4. Typical Property Characteristics

Let’s now turn to some characteristics of the average home in our market:

**Bedrooms and Bathrooms (BR and BA):**

This combination—three bedrooms and three bathrooms—is typical for many of the properties in Santa Clarita. It suggests that most homes are family‑oriented and offer the space necessary for modern living.

**Square Footage (Living Area):**

These numbers tell us that the “typical” home in this market is spacious enough for comfortable living, whether you’re starting out or expanding your family.

**Price per Square Foot ($/SqFt):**

The price per square foot is an important metric for comparing value between homes. In our market, an average in the mid‑$400s suggests that while prices are solid, there is still value to be found—especially when comparing different neighborhoods or property conditions.

**Year Built:**

This indicates that many homes in the market were built in the 1990s. Of course, there’s a wide range—from historic homes dating back to the 1920s to brand‑new builds—so there is plenty of variety depending on your tastes and needs.

**Lot Size:**

**Carport Spaces:**
