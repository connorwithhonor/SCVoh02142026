# Santa Clarita Residential Market Update: Basic Market Statistics

*By your trusted real‐estate guide, here to help you navigate the market with clarity and wisdom.*

## Introduction

When it comes to real estate, knowledge is power. As you know, the Santa Clarita Valley is a diverse market with properties ranging from modest starter homes to luxurious estates. Today, we’re going to look at the overall basic market statistics for residential properties meeting our criteria. In other words, we’ll see the market “as a whole” by looking at averages, minimums, maximums, medians, and sums across several statuses—including “Coming Soon,” “Active,” “Active Under Contract,” “Pending,” “Closed,” “Expired,” “Canceled,” “Hold,” and “Withdrawn.” Whether you’re a first‑time buyer, a seasoned seller, or an investor planning your next move, these numbers will provide a factual basis for making informed decisions.

## What Do the Numbers Tell Us?

Let’s break down the major data points that paint the overall picture of the market.

### 1. Pricing – From Entry Level to High-End

**List Price Overview:**

	- 
	**Minimum List Price:** About $153,900

	This tells us that there are properties on the market with very accessible entry prices—ideal for first‑time buyers or those with limited budgets.

	

	- 
	**Maximum List Price:** Up to $5,099,000

	At the other end of the spectrum, Santa Clarita boasts luxurious listings that offer extensive amenities and space.

	

	- 
	**Average List Price:** Approximately $911,658

	On average, homes fall in the $900,000 range. This is a useful benchmark if you’re trying to gauge what you might expect to pay (or list for) a typical home in the area.

	

	- 
	**Median List Price:** Around $829,000

	With the median slightly lower than the average, the distribution of prices suggests there are some very high‑priced outliers lifting the average. For most buyers and sellers, though, the median price is an excellent indicator of current market conditions.

	

**Takeaway:**

The wide range in list prices—from about $150K to over $5M—demonstrates the market’s diversity. Whether you’re looking for a starter home or a luxury property, there’s a place for you here.

### 2. Market Velocity – How Fast Are Homes Selling?

**Active Days on Market (ADOM):**

	- **For the Overall Market:**

	The average number of days on market is about 62 days, with the median at 42 days.

	- **What This Means:**

	A median of 42 days suggests that, on average, homes are moving fairly briskly. In some fast‑paced segments of the market (or in highly desirable neighborhoods), properties may sell even faster.

	- **Practical Advice:**

	For buyers, this means that if you’ve found a property you love, you might need to act quickly. Sellers, on the other hand, can feel confident that well‑priced homes will attract attention without lingering too long on the market.

### 3. Sale Price to List Price Ratio (SP/LP %)

One of the most telling metrics is the ratio of the sale (close) price to the list price. Here’s what we see across the board:

	- **Minimum SP/LP %:** 93.8%

	- **Maximum SP/LP %:** 121.9%

	- **Average SP/LP %:** Roughly 100.1%

	- **Median SP/LP %:** Exactly 100.0%

**Interpreting the Data:**

	- An average (and median) of about 100% indicates that, overall, properties are selling at about their asking price.

	- In some cases—where the maximum reaches nearly 122%—buyers are willing to pay well above the list price, likely in competitive scenarios or in highly coveted locations.

**What It Means for You:**

For sellers, this is great news—it means that if you price your home appropriately, you’re likely to receive offers at or near your asking price. Buyers should be aware that in competitive segments, you may have to meet the asking price (or even exceed it) to secure your dream home.

### 4. Typical Property Characteristics

Let’s now turn to some characteristics of the average home in our market:

**Bedrooms and Bathrooms (BR and BA):**

	- **Average Bedrooms:** About 3

	- **Average Bathrooms:** Also around 3

This combination—three bedrooms and three bathrooms—is typical for many of the properties in Santa Clarita. It suggests that most homes are family‑oriented and offer the space necessary for modern living.

**Square Footage (Living Area):**

	- **Average SqFt:** Approximately 2,104 square feet

	- **Median SqFt:** Around 1,850 square feet

These numbers tell us that the “typical” home in this market is spacious enough for comfortable living, whether you’re starting out or expanding your family.

**Price per Square Foot ($/SqFt):**

	- **Average Price per SqFt:** Roughly $456.97

	- **Median Price per SqFt:** Around $439.55

The price per square foot is an important metric for comparing value between homes. In our market, an average in the mid‑$400s suggests that while prices are solid, there is still value to be found—especially when comparing different neighborhoods or property conditions.

**Year Built:**

	- **Average Built Year:** About 1994

	- **Median Built Year:** Approximately 1995

This indicates that many homes in the market were built in the 1990s. Of course, there’s a wide range—from historic homes dating back to the 1920s to brand‑new builds—so there is plenty of variety depending on your tastes and needs.

**Lot Size:**

	- **Lot Square Footage:**

	The data show a wide range here. Some properties have very modest lots, while others boast extremely large parcels of land. Although the averages vary by status, you’ll find that the market offers everything from urban-style lots to sprawling acreage.

**Carport Spaces:**

	- On average, properties include about 2 carport spaces. This is another factor that can be important for families or buyers with multiple vehicles.

## What Do These Basic Statistics Mean for You?

### For Buyers

	- 
	**Budgeting and Expectations:**

	Knowing that the median list price is about $829,000—and the average is roughly $911,658—can help you set realistic expectations when you’re house hunting. Keep in mind that while there are some bargain properties starting around $150K, many homes in Santa Clarita fall in the higher range.

	

	- 
	**Act Quickly:**

	With a median ADOM of 42 days, properties in this market tend not to sit for long. If you find a home that fits your needs, it may be wise to make your move without delay.

	

	- 
	**Understanding True Value:**

	A nearly 100% sale-to-list ratio tells you that sellers are pricing homes accurately and that—when priced right—what you see is what you get. Use this information (and our free market analysis tools) to craft competitive offers.

	

### For Sellers

	- 
	**Price Smartly:**

	The data show that properties selling at or near 100% of their asking price indicate a balanced market. Sellers should aim to price their homes competitively to generate interest quickly.

	

	- 
	**Highlight Your Home’s Strengths:**

	With the average home offering three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and around 2,100 square feet of living space, your home’s unique features (such as updated amenities or a larger lot) can help it stand out.

	

	- 
	**Market Timing:**

	Knowing that the average home sells in about 42–62 days means that well‑priced, well‑presented homes don’t linger. Prepare your home for market and plan your next move accordingly.

	

### For Investors

	- 
	**Diverse Opportunities:**

	The wide range in list prices—from under $200K to over $5M—means there are opportunities at every level. Whether you’re looking for a property to flip or a long‑term rental investment, the market’s diversity is a strength.

	

	- 
	**Stability in Sales Prices:**

	With a median SP/LP ratio of 100%, you can generally expect that properties are selling for what they’re listed at. This level of stability makes it easier to predict future trends.

	

	- 
	**Focus on High‑Demand Features:**

	Homes with three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and spacious living areas are popular. Investing in properties with these characteristics in desirable locations can help you achieve a strong return.
