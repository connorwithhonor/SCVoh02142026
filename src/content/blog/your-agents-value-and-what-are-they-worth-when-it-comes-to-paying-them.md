# Your agents value and what are they worth when it comes to paying them

Connor "with Honor" MacIvor - June 17, 2025** [0 Comments](/#comments) | [Add Comment](/#add-comment)
### The Real Estate Agent's Role: Beyond Just Opening Doors

Being a successful real estate agent involves much more than simply opening doors for showings. It requires a deep understanding of market dynamics, meticulous planning, strong negotiation skills, and a commitment to client education. As a First Responder Realtor, I emphasize these aspects, drawing on my LAPD background to bring a unique blend of discipline, strategic thinking, and dedication to every transaction.

#### Strategic Planning for Sellers

For sellers, strategic planning begins long before the "For Sale" sign goes up. It involves:

	- **Comprehensive Market Analysis:** Understanding the current market conditions in Santa Clarita is crucial. This includes analyzing comparable sales, active listings, and absorption rates. My market reports, such as the "[Santa Clarita Real Estate Full Market Recap for Q1 2025 by Connor With Honor](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-real-estate-full-market-recap-for-q1-2025-by-connor-with-honor)" and the "[Santa Clarita Real Estate April 2025: Where is the Market and Where Are We Going?](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-real-estate-april-2025-where-is-the-market-and-where-are-we-going)", provide valuable insights into these trends. Staying informed with publications like "[Santa Clarita Market Update: Surging Inventory and Fresh Buyer Demand](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-real-estate-market-update-surging-inventory-and-fresh-buyerdemand)" is key to understanding fluctuations.

	

	

	- **Optimal Pricing Strategy:** Pricing a home correctly from the outset is paramount. Overpricing can lead to a property sitting on the market, requiring frustrating price reductions. Underpricing leaves money on the table. My goal is to help sellers understand "[What Your Santa Clarita Home is Worth in 2025](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/what-your-santa-clarita-home-is-worth-in-2025-and-what-to-do-next)" and implement a pricing strategy that attracts serious buyers and maximizes their return. For insights into general market values, you can check pages like "[Santa Clarita House Price](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-house-price)".
	

	

	- **Home Preparation and Staging:** As discussed, preparing the home for showings is critical. This might involve decluttering, minor repairs, and professional staging. My "[How to Prepare Your Home for an Open House in Santa Clarita](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/how-to-prepare-your-home-for-an-open-house-in-santa-clarita)" guide offers practical advice to make your home shine for potential buyers.
	

	

	- **Effective Marketing:** Beyond the MLS, effective marketing involves high-quality photography, virtual tours, targeted online advertising, and leveraging social media. I ensure listings, whether it's the beautiful property at "[27931 Balsam Court, Valencia, CA 91354](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/idx/listing/featured/303156416/27931-Balsam-Court-Valencia-CA-91354)" or the inviting home at "[22206 Claibourne Lane, Saugus, CA 91350](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/idx/listing/featured/303329607/22206-Claibourne-Lane-Saugus-CA-91350)", reach a wide audience. You can also learn more about "[How Santa Clarita Sellers Benefit From Using A Local Website Over Zillow](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/how-santa-clarita-sellers-benefit-from-using-a-local-website-over-zillow)" and discover why "[5 Reasons Local Real Estate Sites Outperform Zillow In Santa Clarita Valley](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/5-reasons-local-real-estate-sites-outperform-zillow-in-santa-clarita-valley)".
	

	

	- **Managing Showings and Feedback:** Efficiently managing showing appointments and gathering feedback from prospective buyers and their agents is essential. This feedback provides valuable insights into how the market perceives the property and what adjustments, if any, might be needed.

	- **Negotiation Expertise:** My experience as a retired LAPD officer has honed my negotiation skills, which are invaluable when it comes to "[How To Handle Multiple Offers And Get The Best Deal When Selling Your SCV Home](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/how-to-handle-multiple-offers-and-get-the-best-deal-when-selling-your-scv-home)". I strive to ensure my clients get the "[highest price in the shortest time](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/getting-the-highest-price-in-the-shortest-time)". Learn more about why "[Why Connor With Honor Is The First Responder Realtor You Want Listing Your Home](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-connor-with-honor-is-the-first-responder-realtor-you-want-listing-your-home)" and how I approach situations where "[Buyers Are Not Scared To Write Offers Less Than Your Asking Price](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/buyers-are-not-scared-to-write-offers-less-than-your-asking-price-agent-bs)".
	

	

#### Empowering Buyers with Information and Strategy

For buyers, my role is to equip them with the knowledge and strategy needed to make informed decisions in a competitive market.

	- **Getting Pre-Approved:** The first step for any serious buyer is to get pre-approved for a mortgage. This clarifies their budget and demonstrates their seriousness to sellers. I guide clients through understanding "[mortgage-rates](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/mortgage-rates)" , loan types, and even programs like "[100 Percent Financing On Santa Clarita Real Estate With The MyAccess Program](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/100-percent-financing-on-santa-clarita-real-estate-with-the-myaccess-program)" or "[Zero Down Home Loans For 2025](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/zero-down-home-loans-for-2025-when-buying-in-santa-clarita-valley-rural-and-city)". You can find out how to "[Get Pre-Approved](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/get-pre-approved)" directly on my site.

	

	

	- **Understanding the Market:** Buyers need to understand whether they are entering a "[hot, normal, or cold markets](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/hot-normal-and-cold-markets)". My market updates, like "[Santa Clarita Market Update: Surging Inventory and Fresh Buyer Demand](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-real-estate-market-update-surging-inventory-and-fresh-buyerdemand)", keep clients informed. For local specifics, explore insights into "[Valencia Real Estate Deep Dive: Analyzing the Last 30 Days of Sold Homes 2025](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/valencia-real-estate-deep-dive-analyzing-the-last-30-days-of-sold-homes-2025)" or "[30 Days In Valencia California: Where Home Buyers Go To Get The Best Deals](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/30-days-in-valencia-california-where-home-buyers-go-to-get-the-best-deals)".
	

	

	- **Targeted Home Search:** Utilizing advanced search tools, buyers can quickly find homes that meet their specific criteria, whether it's "[Homes With A Pool For Sale In Santa Clarita Valley, CA](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-with-a-pool-for-sale-in-santa-clarita-valley-ca)" , "[Homes In 55+ Active Adult Communities For Sale In Santa Clarita Valley, CA](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-in-55-active-adult-communities-for-sale-in-santa-clarita-valley-ca)" , or properties near specific high schools like "[Homes for Sale Near Saugus High School, Saugus, CA](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-near-saugus-high-school-saugus-ca)" or "[Homes For Sale Near Valencia High School, Valencia, CA](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-near-valencia-high-school-valencia-ca)". You can explore options by various property types, including "[Condos For Sale In Santa Clarita Valley, CA](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/condos-for-sale-in-santa-clarita-valley-ca)" or "[New Construction Homes For Sale In Santa Clarita Valley, CA](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/new-construction-homes-for-sale-in-santa-clarita-valley-ca)".
	

	

	- **Due Diligence:** From property inspections to understanding environmental issues or potential lead poisoning, thorough due diligence is non-negotiable. I stress the importance of understanding "[Preliminary Reports](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/understanding-preliminary-reports)" and "[Why Do You Need Title Insurance?](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-do-you-need-title-insurance)". Also, be sure to "[Insist On A Home Inspection](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/insist-on-a-home-inspection)".
	

	

	- **Strategic Offer Submission:** In today's market, making a strong and informed offer is crucial. I educate buyers on "[The 2024 Residential Purchase Agreement For A Home Buyer Buying Real Estate](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/the-2024-residential-purchase-agreement-for-a-home-buyer-buying-real-estate)" and the importance of having "[Written Buyer Agreements](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-buyers-need-written-agreements-by-the-first-responder-realtor)". You can also learn about "[Seller Concessions Explained](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/seller-concessions-explained-a-first-responder-realtors-guide-to-selling)".
	

	

	- **Navigating the Closing Process:** From "[The Functions Of An Escrow](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/the-functions-of-an-escrow)" to understanding "[Required Reporting To The IRS](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/required-reporting-to-the-irs)", I guide buyers through every step of the closing process. Learn about different "[Types Of Mortgage Lenders](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/types-of-mortgage-lenders)" and "[The Advantages Of Different Types Of Mortgage Lenders](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/the-advantages-of-different-types-of-mortgage-lenders)".
	

	

### The AI Frontier in Real Estate and Beyond

My passion extends beyond traditional real estate into the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence. I am actively involved in "AI with Honor" and "AiforAgentsOrg", focusing on implementing and integrating AI into real estate agents' businesses, brokerages, and other businesses. AI is revolutionizing how we search for homes, analyze market data, and even personalize client experiences.

	- **AI-Powered Market Insights:** AI can process vast amounts of real estate data to identify trends, predict market shifts, and even assist in home pricing. This means more accurate "Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Reports" for specific communities like "[Acton Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/acton-homes)" , "[Agua Dulce Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/agua-dulce-homes)" , "[Canyon Country Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/canyon-country-homes)" , "[Castaic Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/castaic-homes)" , "[Chatsworth Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/chatsworth-homes)" , "[Granada Hills Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/granada-hills-homes)" , "[Moorpark Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/moorpark-homes)" , "[Newhall Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/newhall-homes)" , "[Northridge Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/northridge-homes)" , "[Porter Ranch Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/porter-ranch-homes)" , "[Saugus Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/saugus-homes)" , "[Simi Valley Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/simi-valley-homes)" , "[Stevenson Ranch Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/stevenson-ranch-homes)" , "[Sylmar Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/sylmar-homes)" , "[Valencia Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/valencia-homes)" , and "[Ventura Homes](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/ventura-homes)". You can also gain insight from the "[Artificial Intelligence Real Estate Report in Valencia CA: Human Initiated](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/artificial-intelligence-real-estate-report-in-valencia-ca-human-initiated)".

	

	

	- **Enhanced Client Experience:** AI can help personalize home searches, recommend properties based on detailed preferences, and even streamline communication. My "[Concept: AI-Enhanced Learning Verification Tool](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/concept-ai-enhanced-learning-verification-tool)" is an example of how I'm exploring these possibilities. Learn about "[How Coming Soon Listings And AI Are Changing Santa Clarita Real Estate In 2025](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/how-coming-soon-listings-and-ai-are-changing-santa-clarita-real-estate-in-2025)".
	

	

	- **Operational Efficiency for Agents:** AI tools can automate repetitive tasks, allowing agents to focus more on client relationships and complex negotiations. I share my "[AI with Honor: Ultimate Agent AI Tools List For My Agents And Business Owners](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/ai-with-honor-ultimate-agent-ai-tools-list-for-my-agents-and-business-owners)" to help other real estate professionals integrate AI into their workflows. You can also explore thoughts on "[It Maybe Time For You To Integrate AI In Your Real Estate Business For 2025](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/it-maybe-time-for-you-to-integrate-ai-in-your-real-estate-business-for-2025)".
	

	

However, I also advocate for "[AI Ethics And Necessity](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/ai-ethics-and-necessity-is-the-mother-of-innovation-is-china-setting-us-up)", emphasizing that while AI is a powerful tool, human intelligence, integrity, and ethical considerations must always be at the forefront. As I've explored in my blog post, "[Don't Trust AI When It Comes To Market Opinions In Santa Clarita Real Estate](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/dont-trust-ai-when-it-comes-to-market-opinions-in-santa-clarita-real-estate)", human judgment and experience remain irreplaceable. I believe in a future where AI augments human capabilities, rather than replacing them, especially in a relationship-driven industry like real estate. You can also find philosophical discussions like "[Is The New Alien Intelligence Going To Be Catholic Muslim Christian Buddhist](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/is-the-new-alien-intelligence-going-to-be-catholic-muslim-christian-buddhist)" or "[The Vatican Weighs In On Artificial Intelligence](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/the-vatican-weighs-in-on-artificial-intelligence)".

### My Personal Journey: From LAPD to Real Estate and Wellness

My journey from 17 years as an LAPD officer (and 5 as a reserve) to a full-time Realtor is foundational to my approach. This background instilled in me a deep understanding of service, negotiation, and resilience. I've been to hostage negotiator school, which directly translates to my ability to "[Hire A Strong Negotiator In Santa Clarita Real Estate Not Just A Sack Of Bones](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/hire-a-strong-negotiator-in-santa-clarita-real-estate-not-just-a-sack-of-bones)" for my clients. This unique experience allows me to "[Add Value To The Home Buyer Experience One Honest Sale At A Time](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/adding-value-to-the-home-buyer-experience-one-honest-sale-at-a-time)". Explore more about "[Why Working With A First Responder Turned Realtor Gives You The Edge](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-working-with-a-first-responder-turned-realtor-gives-you-the-edge)".

Beyond my real estate career, I am passionately dedicated to health and fitness. My personal transformation, dropping 135 pounds of fat in about 7.5 months through intermittent fasting and testosterone therapy, is a testament to my belief in self-improvement and dedication. This journey, which I share on @Homemuscle and @FastingwithHonor, underscores my commitment to living with "honor" in all aspects of life. I believe that it's "[Easier To Be Fit And Depressed Than Fat And Depressed](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/it-is-easier-to-be-fit-and-depressed-than-fat-and-depressed)" , and that "[No One Is Coming To Save You But You Can Save Yourself](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/no-one-is-coming-to-save-you-but-you-can-save-yourself-if-you-dare-to)". These principles of self-reliance and continuous improvement guide my professional and personal endeavors. For more on my fitness journey, visit "[From Fat To Fit: A First Responder's Journey To Health, Muscle, And Longevity](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/from-fat-to-fit-a-first-responders-journey-to-health-muscle-and-longevity)" or "[What If Fasting Was The Way We All Torched Off Body Fat And Kept Healthy](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/what-if-fasting-was-the-way-we-all-torched-off-body-fat-and-kept-healthy)".

My experiences in law enforcement taught me to be observant, analytical, and always prepared. This translates directly into how I represent my clients. For instance, I know the importance of "[Knowing Which Homes Are Priced To Sell](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/first-responder-realtor-know-which-homes-are-priced-to-sell)" and understanding the subtle cues in negotiations. I don't just "show their strength" as an agent; I apply real-world skills to protect my clients' interests.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
