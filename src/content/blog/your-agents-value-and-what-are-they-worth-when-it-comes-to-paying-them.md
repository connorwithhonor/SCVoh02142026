# Your agents value and what are they worth when it comes to paying them

Connor "with Honor" MacIvor - June 17, 2025** [0 Comments](/#comments) | [Add Comment](/#add-comment)
### The Real Estate Agent's Role: Beyond Just Opening Doors

Being a successful real estate agent involves much more than simply opening doors for showings. It requires a deep understanding of market dynamics, meticulous planning, strong negotiation skills, and a commitment to client education. As a First Responder Realtor, I emphasize these aspects, drawing on my LAPD background to bring a unique blend of discipline, strategic thinking, and dedication to every transaction.

#### Strategic Planning for Sellers

For sellers, strategic planning begins long before the "For Sale" sign goes up. It involves:

#### Empowering Buyers with Information and Strategy

For buyers, my role is to equip them with the knowledge and strategy needed to make informed decisions in a competitive market.

### The AI Frontier in Real Estate and Beyond

My passion extends beyond traditional real estate into the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence. I am actively involved in "AI with Honor" and "AiforAgentsOrg", focusing on implementing and integrating AI into real estate agents' businesses, brokerages, and other businesses. AI is revolutionizing how we search for homes, analyze market data, and even personalize client experiences.

However, I also advocate for "[AI Ethics And Necessity](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/ai-ethics-and-necessity-is-the-mother-of-innovation-is-china-setting-us-up)", emphasizing that while AI is a powerful tool, human intelligence, integrity, and ethical considerations must always be at the forefront. As I've explored in my blog post, "[Don't Trust AI When It Comes To Market Opinions In Santa Clarita Real Estate](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/dont-trust-ai-when-it-comes-to-market-opinions-in-santa-clarita-real-estate)", human judgment and experience remain irreplaceable. I believe in a future where AI augments human capabilities, rather than replacing them, especially in a relationship-driven industry like real estate. You can also find philosophical discussions like "[Is The New Alien Intelligence Going To Be Catholic Muslim Christian Buddhist](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/is-the-new-alien-intelligence-going-to-be-catholic-muslim-christian-buddhist)" or "[The Vatican Weighs In On Artificial Intelligence](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/the-vatican-weighs-in-on-artificial-intelligence)".

### My Personal Journey: From LAPD to Real Estate and Wellness

My journey from 17 years as an LAPD officer (and 5 as a reserve) to a full-time Realtor is foundational to my approach. This background instilled in me a deep understanding of service, negotiation, and resilience. I've been to hostage negotiator school, which directly translates to my ability to "[Hire A Strong Negotiator In Santa Clarita Real Estate Not Just A Sack Of Bones](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/hire-a-strong-negotiator-in-santa-clarita-real-estate-not-just-a-sack-of-bones)" for my clients. This unique experience allows me to "[Add Value To The Home Buyer Experience One Honest Sale At A Time](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/adding-value-to-the-home-buyer-experience-one-honest-sale-at-a-time)". Explore more about "[Why Working With A First Responder Turned Realtor Gives You The Edge](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-working-with-a-first-responder-turned-realtor-gives-you-the-edge)".

Beyond my real estate career, I am passionately dedicated to health and fitness. My personal transformation, dropping 135 pounds of fat in about 7.5 months through intermittent fasting and testosterone therapy, is a testament to my belief in self-improvement and dedication. This journey, which I share on @Homemuscle and @FastingwithHonor, underscores my commitment to living with "honor" in all aspects of life. I believe that it's "[Easier To Be Fit And Depressed Than Fat And Depressed](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/it-is-easier-to-be-fit-and-depressed-than-fat-and-depressed)" , and that "[No One Is Coming To Save You But You Can Save Yourself](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/no-one-is-coming-to-save-you-but-you-can-save-yourself-if-you-dare-to)". These principles of self-reliance and continuous improvement guide my professional and personal endeavors. For more on my fitness journey, visit "[From Fat To Fit: A First Responder's Journey To Health, Muscle, And Longevity](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/from-fat-to-fit-a-first-responders-journey-to-health-muscle-and-longevity)" or "[What If Fasting Was The Way We All Torched Off Body Fat And Kept Healthy](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/what-if-fasting-was-the-way-we-all-torched-off-body-fat-and-kept-healthy)".

My experiences in law enforcement taught me to be observant, analytical, and always prepared. This translates directly into how I represent my clients. For instance, I know the importance of "[Knowing Which Homes Are Priced To Sell](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/first-responder-realtor-know-which-homes-are-priced-to-sell)" and understanding the subtle cues in negotiations. I don't just "show their strength" as an agent; I apply real-world skills to protect my clients' interests.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
