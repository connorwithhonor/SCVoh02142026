**Fit to Fat to Fit Again: The Real Journey to Sustainable Weight Loss – Part 1**

Losing fat is tough, no doubt about it. If you’ve been trying for a long time, I know you can relate. I still struggle with aspects of it myself, but today, things are easier than they used to be. Why? Because now, we have more knowledge about weight loss, metabolism, and the real impact of diet and exercise.

Unfortunately, we also have weight loss drugs making big promises. They tout rapid weight loss, but the problem? Much of that weight isn’t just fat—it’s muscle loss. That’s a disaster for long-term health, strength, and metabolism. So today, we’re going to talk about what really works: fasting, caloric restriction (and its pitfalls), and the right way to eat and train to burn fat while keeping muscle.

### The Truth About Caloric Restriction

One of the biggest myths out there is that simply cutting calories is the way to lose weight. If you’ve been stuck in the diet cycle—restricting food, feeling miserable, then regaining everything—you know this method doesn’t work long-term.

Your body is a survival machine. If you suddenly slash your calorie intake from, say, 3,000 down to 1,200, your metabolism slows to match. That means you burn fewer calories, feel sluggish, and stop seeing progress. Then, when you return to normal eating, the weight piles back on because your metabolism is still in “starvation mode.”

Caloric restriction alone is a bad strategy. It’s why so many diets fail.

### The Better Alternative: Fasting and Smart Eating

If you want sustainable fat loss, fasting is one of the most effective tools you can use. Fasting resets your metabolism and improves insulin sensitivity, which is the key to unlocking stored body fat. But not all fasting is the same. You don’t want to starve yourself without a plan.

Here’s the better approach:

	- 
	**Intermittent Fasting (IF):** Eat in a shorter window each day, such as 16:8 (16 hours fasting, 8-hour eating window).

	

	- 
	**Extended Fasting:** Occasionally go 24-72 hours without food to reset hunger hormones and boost fat burning.

	

	- 
	**Dry Fasting:** More advanced, but can accelerate results. This means no food or water for a set period, which forces the body to burn stored fat more efficiently.

	

When you do eat, it’s crucial to fuel your body with the right foods. If you’re eating highly processed junk, fasting alone won’t fix the problem. You need whole, nutrient-dense foods that support fat loss and muscle retention.

### The Five Essential Food Groups for Fat Loss

If you want to get lean while maintaining muscle, your diet should be based on five simple categories:

	- 
	**Meat (Beef, Chicken, Pork, Lamb, etc.)** – Prioritize grass-fed and unprocessed options.

	

	- 
	**Eggs** – A perfect protein source that fuels muscle retention.

	

	- 
	**Fish (Salmon, Sardines, Tuna, etc.)** – Rich in healthy fats and omega-3s.

	

	- 
	**Vegetables** – Provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals without excess carbs.

	

	- 
	**Fruits** – Stick to whole fruits, not juices. Berries, apples, and citrus are great choices.

	

If it’s processed, comes in a bag, or has more than one ingredient, it’s probably not helping you. Read labels carefully. Even so-called “healthy” foods can be packed with hidden sugars and preservatives.

### Why Strength Training is Non-Negotiable

Most people focus on cardio for weight loss, but lifting weights is just as—if not more—important. When you lose weight, you don’t just lose fat. Without resistance training, you lose muscle too. That slows metabolism and makes it harder to stay lean long-term.

You don’t need a gym membership or fancy equipment. A simple set of dumbbells can transform your physique. Here’s a minimal-effort routine anyone can do:

	- 
	**Bicep Curls** – 3 sets of 10

	

	- 
	**Shoulder Presses** – 3 sets of 10

	

	- 
	**Lateral Raises** – 3 sets of 10

	

	- 
	**Squats (with or without weights)** – 3 sets of 15

	

Even just 5-10 minutes a day can make a huge difference. The key is consistency. Your body thrives on movement, and even small amounts of strength training will help preserve muscle while you burn fat.

### The Dangers of Sugar and Artificial Sweeteners

One of the biggest sabotaging factors in weight loss is sugar. High insulin levels make fat loss nearly impossible, and sugar is the fastest way to spike insulin.

Even if you think you’re avoiding sugar, it’s hidden in sauces, dressings, and processed foods. Ketchup, for example, is packed with sugar. Fruit juices? They’re just sugar water. And don’t even get me started on soda.

Even diet sodas can be harmful. Artificial sweeteners trick your body into thinking sugar is coming, causing an insulin response. This is why Diet Coke and similar drinks don’t actually help with weight loss—they mess with your metabolism. Stick to water, black coffee, and herbal teas.

### The Mindset Shift: Food is Fuel, Not Entertainment

One of the biggest transformations in my journey from 365 pounds to where I am now was realizing food isn’t supposed to be entertainment. It’s fuel.

When I was at my heaviest, I mindlessly ate. Food was comfort, a habit, something I did without thinking. If that sounds familiar, you’re not alone. The key to breaking that cycle is awareness. Start tracking what you eat, even if just mentally. Before you put something in your mouth, ask yourself: **Is this helping me reach my goal, or setting me back?**

Over time, the shift happens. Food stops being an emotional crutch and becomes a tool for energy, strength, and health.

### The Power of Fasting: A Case Study

Let me leave you with an extreme but powerful example. A man named Angus Barbieri fasted for 382 days. That’s over a year without food—just black coffee, water, and multivitamins. He lost a massive amount of fat and proved that our bodies are more adaptable than we think.

I’m not saying you need to go a year without eating, but understand this: Your body has stored energy (fat) for a reason. If you learn how to tap into that and control hunger, you can achieve incredible results.

### Coming Up in Part 2

In Part 2, we’re going to dive even deeper into the science of fasting, why most people fail at diets, and the ultimate strategy for long-term success. We’ll also talk about my personal experience—the highs and lows of my transformation—and how you can apply these lessons to your own journey.

Stay tuned, and if you’re ready to take control of your body and health, start making these small shifts today.

I’m Connor with Honor. You CAN do this. See you in the next one!

**Part 2: Advanced Strategies for Long-Term Fat Loss and Fitness**

### The Science of Fasting and Why Most Diets Fail

Many people struggle with long-term weight loss because they rely on outdated ideas about dieting. The reason most diets fail isn’t that people lack willpower—it’s that their approach doesn’t align with how the body actually works.

When you eat, especially carbohydrates and sugar, your insulin levels spike. Insulin is the storage hormone that tells your body to store fat. If insulin levels remain high, your body never taps into stored fat for energy. This is why traditional diets that rely on frequent small meals or excessive calorie restriction backfire.

Fasting, on the other hand, keeps insulin levels low and allows your body to burn stored fat for fuel. This is how our ancestors survived during times of food scarcity.

Types of fasting include:

	- 
	**Time-Restricted Eating (TRE):** Eating within a specific window, such as 16:8 or 20:4.

	

	- 
	**OMAD (One Meal a Day):** A form of intermittent fasting that can boost weight loss and discipline.

	

	- 
	**48-72 Hour Fasting:** Extended fasting that resets metabolism and enhances autophagy (cellular repair).

	

	- 
	**Dry Fasting:** No food or water for a period of time—forces the body to rely entirely on stored fat.

	

These methods allow for fat-burning without the metabolic slowdown caused by severe calorie restriction.

### The Hidden Dangers of Processed Foods and Modern Nutrition

One major roadblock in weight loss is processed food. Many "diet" foods still contain artificial ingredients, sugar, and preservatives that spike insulin and cause cravings. Even something as simple as ketchup or salad dressing can contain hidden sugars that sabotage progress.

Instead, focus on whole, single-ingredient foods:

	- 
	Meat (grass-fed when possible)

	

	- 
	Eggs

	

	- 
	Fish

	

	- 
	Low-carb vegetables

	

	- 
	Whole fruits in moderation

	

When you cut out processed food, your body stops craving sugar and stabilizes its natural hunger signals.

### The Role of Hormones in Fat Loss

Beyond calories, your hormones play a major role in weight loss. Here are some key ones to watch:

	- 
	**Insulin:** High insulin levels prevent fat loss. Lowering insulin through fasting and carb reduction helps burn fat efficiently.

	

	- 
	**Ghrelin (Hunger Hormone):** Fasting helps reset ghrelin so your body learns to be hungry only when it truly needs fuel.

	

	- 
	**Leptin (Satiety Hormone):** Overeating disrupts leptin, making you feel hungrier. Fasting and whole foods help restore it.

	

	- 
	**Cortisol (Stress Hormone):** Chronic stress raises cortisol, leading to fat storage. Prioritize sleep and stress management.

	

By understanding these hormones, you can work *with* your body instead of against it.

### My Personal Journey: The Hard Truths About Losing Over 135 Pounds

When I started my fat loss journey, I was 365 pounds with a 65-inch waist. I had tried every diet under the sun—caloric restriction, low-fat, meal replacements, and none of them worked. It wasn’t until I discovered fasting, eliminated processed food, and focused on strength training that I saw real, sustainable results.

But here’s the truth:

	- 
	**Weight loss isn’t linear.** Some weeks I dropped 10 pounds, others nothing. The key was staying consistent.

	

	- 
	**Your mind has to change before your body does.** If you always fall back into the same habits, you’ll regain the weight.

	

	- 
	**Lifting weights is essential.** Cardio alone won’t maintain muscle mass or boost metabolism. Strength training keeps you lean.

	

I made peace with hunger, stopped fearing fasting, and started focusing on *fueling* my body instead of constantly dieting. The shift in mindset made all the difference.

### Building a Sustainable Lifestyle (Not Just a Temporary Fix)

If you want permanent results, your approach needs to be sustainable. Here’s what works long-term:

	- 
	**Make Fasting a Lifestyle:** Find a method that works for you and stick with it.

	

	- 
	**Prioritize Protein:** Protein preserves muscle and keeps you full.

	

	- 
	**Eliminate Processed Carbs:** Stick with real, whole foods.

	

	- 
	**Train with Resistance:** Even simple dumbbell workouts will prevent muscle loss.

	

	- 
	**Get Enough Sleep:** Poor sleep leads to cravings and fat storage.

	

	- 
	**Reduce Stress:** Meditation, walks, or even deep breathing can lower cortisol.

	

	- 
	**Stay Hydrated:** Water is key for metabolism and detoxification.

	

### Final Thoughts: What’s Next in Your Fat Loss Journey?

If you’ve been struggling to lose weight, I get it. It’s overwhelming, frustrating, and often discouraging. But you don’t need another fad diet or magic pill. You need a plan based on science, discipline, and real-world experience.

You *can* lose fat and build muscle at the same time. You *can* get stronger, healthier, and feel better than ever. But it won’t happen overnight. The sooner you start treating food as fuel and fasting as a tool, the sooner you’ll see results.

I’m Connor with Honor. You CAN do this. Reach out to me if I can help. And remember—*consistency is king.*
