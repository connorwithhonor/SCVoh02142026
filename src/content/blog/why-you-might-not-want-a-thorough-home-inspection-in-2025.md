### Why You Might NOT Want a Thorough Home Inspection in 2025 When Buying Santa Clarita Real Estate – The Shocking Truth Revealed!

**TL;DR**: Thinking about skipping a home inspection to save time or money when buying in Santa Clarita? Hold up! As a former LAPD officer and Realtor since 1998 (CALDRE 01238257), I’m diving into the risky reasons some buyers avoid thorough inspections—and why that could be a colossal mistake or, in rare cases, a strategic move. From hidden costs to deal-killing delays, this guide exposes the pros and cons.
