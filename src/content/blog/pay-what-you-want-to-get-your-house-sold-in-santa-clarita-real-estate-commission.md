### Santa Clarita Open Houses and Connor with Honor Present: The New Commissions Concessions Intel from Your Local Agent

Welcome to July 24th, Santa Clarita!

![](https://idx-acnt-ihouseprd.b-cdn.net/AR1197716/file_manager/santa%20clarita%20open%20houses%20live%20streaming%20podcast.png?width=500&amp;height=281&amp;aspect_ratio=500%3A281)Good morning, everyone! This is Connor MacIvor, also known as Connor with Honor, from SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com. Today, we're diving deep into what's happening in real estate, and we're addressing a hot topic: commission concessions! This is something that's going to be on everyone's mind very soon.

**Houses Not Selling in the "Normal" Time? Is the Market Shifting?**

Join me as we explore these questions and more in today's update! Check out the latest video here: [https://youtu.be/rZV-IInQXmI](https://youtu.be/rZV-IInQXmI)

**What's Happening in Real Estate?**

**Market Overview:**

**Property Types:** Single-family residences are what most people think of – standalone homes with different configurations. Some might share a common wall with a neighbor, especially in older developments. Newer homes might have zero lot lines, meaning your property line might extend into your neighbor's yard for maintenance purposes.

**Average Days on Market:**

**Price Changes:** We’re seeing 60 to 70 price changes every week, mostly reductions. These aren’t huge cuts – typically $3,000 to $10,000. Sellers adjust prices when their homes aren't getting offers.

**Commission Concessions:** The big change coming up is the removal of commission offers from the MLS due to a lawsuit. Here’s what that means for you:

**Buyers:**

**Sellers:**

**Commission Disclosure:**

**Showings and Open Houses:** Showings can be coordinated to minimize inconvenience. Weekend open houses or evening showings can work for those with busy schedules.

**Market Strategy:** Setting the right price initially is crucial. Overpricing leads to longer market times and inevitable price reductions, which can be emotionally taxing for sellers.

**Final Thoughts:** Stay informed about the changes in commission rules and how they affect your buying or selling process. Understanding these changes can save you time, money, and stress.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
