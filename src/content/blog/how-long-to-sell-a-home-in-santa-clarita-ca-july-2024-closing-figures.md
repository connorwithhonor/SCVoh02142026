Welcome to the final day of July 2024, and with it, one of the most comprehensive market updates you’ll encounter for Santa Clarita real estate. Today, we’ll delve into the latest trends, statistics, and insights to help you navigate this dynamic market.

As of today, we have 467 active units for sale across the Santa Clarita Valley cities. These include Castaic, Canyon Country, Newhall, Saugus, Stevenson Ranch, and Valencia. Despite what might appear as a stagnant market, many listings are moving quickly, typically going into escrow within 7 to 14 days of hitting the market. This rapid movement indicates a robust market where properties are highly sought after.

## Key Market Statistics

Here’s a breakdown of the current market statistics:

	- **Active Units:** 467

	- **Coming Soon:** 8

	- **New Listings (last 7 days):** 81

	- **Price Changes:** 80

	- **Back on Market:** 23

	- **Active Under Contract:** 38

	- **Deeper Escrow:** 52

	- **Closed (last 7 days):** 58

	- **Expired Listings:** 5

	- **Canceled Listings:** 11

	- **On Hold:** 9

	- **Withdrawn Listings:** 3

### Understanding the Market Trends

We’re seeing typical market behavior where overpriced properties initially undergo price adjustments to attract more buyers. This tactic helps listings regain visibility on syndication sites, increasing their chances of selling.

When it comes to financing, especially with VA loans, there might be delays due to appraisal schedules. However, lenders well-versed in VA loans can streamline this process, making it comparable to conventional loan timelines.

## Navigating Buying and Selling in the Current Market

### For Sellers:

If you’re considering selling, it’s crucial to be aware of the current dynamics. Properties are moving fast, but pricing them correctly from the start is key to avoiding the need for price reductions later. Also, be prepared for potential delays if the buyer is using federal loans, which could extend the typical 30 to 45-day escrow period.

### For Buyers:

For buyers, the competition is fierce. Many properties receive multiple offers, sometimes exceeding the listing price. While this can be daunting, it’s essential to ensure that any offer above the listing price is justified and sustainable for your financial situation. Overpaying can delay building equity in your new home.

### Financing Tips:

	- Always consult with your lender before making any financial moves, such as paying off credit cards, which could unexpectedly impact your credit score.

	- Stay in close contact with your lender throughout the buying process to avoid any surprises that could derail your financing.

## Looking Ahead

As we move into August, we’re anticipating potential changes in interest rates. While there has been much speculation about a decrease, it’s essential not to base your buying decisions solely on these predictions. Stay informed, but make decisions based on your current needs and financial situation.
