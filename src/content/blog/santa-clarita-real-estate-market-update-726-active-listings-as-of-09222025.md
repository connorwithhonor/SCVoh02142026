# Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Update: 726 Active Listings as of September 22, 2025

  
    
  

**TL;DR:** As of 1:30 PM PDT on September 22, 2025, the Santa Clarita Valley real estate market features 726 total residential listings, including 720 active properties and 6 Coming Soon listings, marking a six-month low since February 2025. The median list price is approximately $750,000, with an average days on market of 65. Mortgage rates have dropped to 6.26% nationally, per Freddie Mac, potentially influencing local demand. This update provides a detailed analysis of current inventory, pricing trends, neighborhood data, and practical considerations for buyers and sellers based on CRMLS statistics and recent seller consultations.

This report is compiled based on data from the "Statistics Sheet 7 days all scv totals.pdf" and "Total santa clarita listings including coming soon, sfr, condo, townhome, all residencial 0922025.pdf" documents, analyzed as of today, September 22, 2025, at 1:30 PM PDT. As Connor MacIvor, a Realtor with CALDRE 01238257, I bring a background from my time as an LAPD motor cop, expertise in fasting and muscle building, and proficiency in artificial intelligence applications for real estate. Having worked across all SCV neighborhoods, I aim to deliver a factual, data-driven overview to support informed decisions, drawing solely from the provided documents and my professional experience.

## Introduction and Market Context

Good day, everyone. Welcome to September 22, 2025, at 1:30 PM PDT. This is a real estate update for the Santa Clarita Valley (SCV), covering Canyon Country, Saugus, Valencia, Newhall, Castaic, Stevenson Ranch, Acton, and Agua Dulce. The market currently includes 726 total residential listings, comprising 720 active properties and 6 Coming Soon listings, representing the lowest inventory level in six months since February 2025. This update follows a recent consultation with sellers who expressed concerns about property preparation costs and valuation strategies, which will be addressed alongside a detailed breakdown of the market data.

Nationally, mortgage rates have decreased to 6.26% as of September 18, 2025, according to Freddie Mac, down from 6.35%, influenced by the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut on September 17, 2025. This rate reduction, projected to potentially reach 6.13% by year-end per CBS News, may stimulate buyer activity. However, national home value growth has slowed to its lowest pace in two years, with a 18% year-over-year inventory increase reported by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), contrasting with SCV’s current tight supply. Locally, the median list price across active listings is approximately $750,000, with an average days on market of 65, indicating a balanced yet competitive market.

## Seller Consultations and Valuation Insights

During a recent consultation on September 21, 2025, two sellers expressed reluctance to invest further in their property to prepare it for sale. Their primary concern was avoiding additional costs, with a secondary question about what improvements might be necessary. From a valuation perspective, several factors are critical:

	- **Comparable Sales (Comps):** Appraisers typically use properties sold within the past 180 days as a benchmark, though closer timeframes (e.g., the current month) are preferable for accuracy. This depends on market conditions and the cost of bringing in comps, but 180 days is a standard rule of thumb. Properties beyond this period may be considered only with extenuating circumstances, such as unique market shifts.

	- **Proximity and Similarity:** Comps should be in the same neighborhood or nearby, closed recently, and similar in year built, condition, and upgrades. For example, if comparable properties have undergone copper repiping or roof replacements while the subject property retains original features, this impacts valuation. Buyers will compare these factors when making offers.

	- **Current Market Advantage:** With 726 listings marking a six-month low, competition is reduced. For the consulted sellers, their property’s condition aligns with available comps, suggesting no immediate need for upgrades. This lack of direct competition supports listing in its current state.

Monitoring daily updates at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/blog](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/blog) can keep sellers informed on market shifts.

## National Market Context

Nationally, home value growth has slowed to its lowest pace in two years, per Realtor.com and Redfin, with a 18% year-over-year inventory increase per NAR. Mortgage rates at 6.26% (Freddie Mac, September 18, 2025) reflect a post-Fed cut trend, potentially boosting SCV demand. The median sale price of $772,000 (down 2.8% YoY, Redfin) contrasts with the 65 DOM average, indicating selective buying.

## Buyer Considerations

With 726 listings, competition is high for desirable properties. Key actions include:

	- **Pre-Approval:** At 6.26%, a $750,000 loan costs ~$4,600/month (principal and interest). Details at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/items-you-need-when-applying-for-a-loan](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/items-you-need-when-applying-for-a-loan).

	- **New Listings:** Track 6 Coming Soon properties at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings).

	- **Inspections:** Essential for due diligence, per [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/importance-of-inspection](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/importance-of-inspection).

	- **Concessions:** Negotiate seller assistance post-NAR, via [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/becoming-a-santa-clarita-commission-and-concessions-expert-in-real-estate](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/becoming-a-santa-clarita-commission-and-concessions-expert-in-real-estate).

	- **Focus Areas:** $500,000-$900,000 (351 listings) offers balance.
