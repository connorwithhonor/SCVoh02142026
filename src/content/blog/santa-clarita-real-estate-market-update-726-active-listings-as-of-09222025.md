# Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Update: 726 Active Listings as of September 22, 2025

  
**TL;DR:** As of 1:30 PM PDT on September 22, 2025, the Santa Clarita Valley real estate market features 726 total residential listings, including 720 active properties and 6 Coming Soon listings, marking a six-month low since February 2025. The median list price is approximately $750,000, with an average days on market of 65. Mortgage rates have dropped to 6.26% nationally, per Freddie Mac, potentially influencing local demand. This update provides a detailed analysis of current inventory, pricing trends, neighborhood data, and practical considerations for buyers and sellers based on CRMLS statistics and recent seller consultations.

This report is compiled based on data from the "Statistics Sheet 7 days all scv totals.pdf" and "Total santa clarita listings including coming soon, sfr, condo, townhome, all residencial 0922025.pdf" documents, analyzed as of today, September 22, 2025, at 1:30 PM PDT. As Connor MacIvor, a Realtor with CALDRE 01238257, I bring a background from my time as an LAPD motor cop, expertise in fasting and muscle building, and proficiency in artificial intelligence applications for real estate. Having worked across all SCV neighborhoods, I aim to deliver a factual, data-driven overview to support informed decisions, drawing solely from the provided documents and my professional experience.

## Introduction and Market Context

Good day, everyone. Welcome to September 22, 2025, at 1:30 PM PDT. This is a real estate update for the Santa Clarita Valley (SCV), covering Canyon Country, Saugus, Valencia, Newhall, Castaic, Stevenson Ranch, Acton, and Agua Dulce. The market currently includes 726 total residential listings, comprising 720 active properties and 6 Coming Soon listings, representing the lowest inventory level in six months since February 2025. This update follows a recent consultation with sellers who expressed concerns about property preparation costs and valuation strategies, which will be addressed alongside a detailed breakdown of the market data.

Nationally, mortgage rates have decreased to 6.26% as of September 18, 2025, according to Freddie Mac, down from 6.35%, influenced by the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut on September 17, 2025. This rate reduction, projected to potentially reach 6.13% by year-end per CBS News, may stimulate buyer activity. However, national home value growth has slowed to its lowest pace in two years, with a 18% year-over-year inventory increase reported by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), contrasting with SCV’s current tight supply. Locally, the median list price across active listings is approximately $750,000, with an average days on market of 65, indicating a balanced yet competitive market.

## Detailed Breakdown of Coming Soon Listings

The Coming Soon category consists of 6 single-family residences not yet available for offers but included in the total inventory count. The data is as follows:

These properties represent mid-to-upper-range options, with lot sizes varying widely, suggesting a mix of urban and semi-rural locations. Their pre-active status means they will likely impact market dynamics once listed.

## Detailed Breakdown of Active Listings

The active category includes 720 properties, detailed by price range based on the "Statistics Sheet 7 days all scv totals.pdf":

### $200,000 - $300,000 (7 Listings)

### Overall Active Listings Summary
