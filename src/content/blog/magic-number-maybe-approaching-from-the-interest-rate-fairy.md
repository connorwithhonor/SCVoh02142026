Call me. I believe I can win your trust and eventually your business. Here is my daily Santa Clarita real estate update and I have some other information you can see that well be of help at this time in September 2024.

Kind of like leaving your tooth under a pillow, magically, if you were in my family, you'd find some money, and the tooth, when it was unable to be found by your parents. It wasn't long after that, or before in my case, when you saw the tooth fairy as something it was not intended to be. Your parents.

But, interest rates don't have a fairy and they are not controlled by your parents. Money drives the rates and that money is tied to all sorts of things, one being the 10 year bond, the economy and the fed funds rate.&nbsp;

The FED funds rate, that is what the meeting tomorrow, the 17th and the 18th will be about. I envision it like a long table with water in those fancy pitchers in the center and everyone sitting around discussing our fate.

I looked at some photos, it's an circular square table and the center is way too far to have water there. It appears they all get the same cute bottles of water tho.

**"Is the Magic Number Approaching? Analyzing the Santa Clarita Valley Real Estate Market Trends and Interest Rates!"**

The Santa Clarita Valley real estate market is always full of surprises, and September 2024 is no different. The local market continues to be dynamic, with new opportunities for buyers and sellers unfolding daily. A key topic of discussion among real estate enthusiasts and professionals is the possible arrival of a "magic number" in terms of interest rates. What could this mean for the real estate market in Santa Clarita Valley, and how might it affect your buying or selling strategy?

Let's dive into the numbers to get a clearer picture of where the market stands and what you can expect moving forward.

## **Current Market Inventory Overview**

As of now, there are **544 total active residential listings** in the Santa Clarita Valley, which includes single-family residences, condominiums, and townhomes. Here's a detailed look at the current market activity:

## **What Does This Mean for Buyers and Sellers?**

### **For Buyers:**

With 81 new listings and 90 price changes, there’s plenty of movement in the market, offering buyers a range of choices and potential deals. The fact that 23 properties are back on the market suggests that there may be opportunities to revisit previously unavailable homes. Additionally, keep an eye on the 11 properties listed as "Coming Soon" for first dibs on new inventory.

### **For Sellers:**

The market remains competitive, as indicated by the 40 homes currently under contract and 41 pending sales. With 52 homes recently closed, sellers still have strong opportunities to attract motivated buyers. However, understanding the impact of recent price changes and the overall inventory is crucial for pricing your home competitively.

## **Interest Rates: Is the "Magic Number" on the Horizon?**

As always, interest rates play a critical role in determining market activity. With talks of a potential "magic number" on the horizon, many are speculating about whether we could see a favorable shift soon. Lower interest rates can increase buying power, potentially driving more buyers into the market and creating a competitive landscape. This could mean higher prices and fewer concessions from sellers.
