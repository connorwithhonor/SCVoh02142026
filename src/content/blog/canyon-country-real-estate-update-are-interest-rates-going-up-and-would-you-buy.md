**November 22, 2024**&nbsp;– Day 327 of the Year – Week 47

Welcome to the Canyon Country Real Estate Update! Today, we’re diving deep into the real estate market trends in Canyon Country, California, exploring the impact of interest rates, seller motivation, and key questions every buyer and seller should consider. Whether you're actively in the market or just curious, this comprehensive overview is for you.

### **Market Snapshot: What Happened in the Last 7 Days?**

Canyon Country is buzzing with activity! Over the past week, the market showed its dynamic nature with numbers that indicate consistent buyer and seller engagement:

	- **13 New Listings**: Canyon Country leads the Santa Clarita Valley in new properties entering the market, offering fresh opportunities for buyers.

	- **11 Price Changes**: This high number reflects motivated sellers adjusting to market realities, creating potential opportunities for buyers.

	- **3 Back on Market**: These homes returned to active status, often due to buyer financing issues or other unforeseen circumstances.

	- **10 Active Under Contract &amp; 5 Pending**: A total of 15 properties are moving through escrow, demonstrating strong demand.

	- **16 Closed Sales**: Finalized transactions highlight that buyers are still closing deals, despite higher interest rates.

	- **Minimal Withdrawn, Expired, and Canceled Listings**: With only 2 expired, 1 canceled, and 4 hold listings, it’s clear that sellers remain committed to the process.

### **Is Now a Good Time to Buy or Sell in Canyon Country?**

#### **For Sellers:**

If you’re thinking about selling, you might wonder, “Is now the right time?” Here’s what the data and trends suggest:

	- **Price Adjustments Indicate Negotiability:**&nbsp;With 11 price changes, sellers are showing flexibility, but pricing your home competitively from the start is key. Homes that enter the market at the right price sell faster and often attract multiple offers.

	- **Low Withdrawn Listings Reflect Commitment:**&nbsp;The low number of withdrawn and expired listings indicates sellers are willing to stick it out and find the right buyer.

	- **Seasonal Considerations:**&nbsp;While some might wait until after the holidays to sell, now is an excellent time to capture motivated buyers looking to close before year-end.

#### **For Buyers:**

Buyers face a unique landscape with opportunities and challenges:

	- **Sellers Are Open to Negotiation:**&nbsp;Don’t hesitate to make an offer, even if it’s below asking price. Many properties are selling below their original list prices, and motivated sellers are willing to negotiate.

	- **Interest Rates at 7.5%:**&nbsp;Yes, rates are high compared to recent years, but they may increase further. Waiting could mean paying more for the same home down the road.

	- **Inventory Opportunities:**&nbsp;With 13 new listings and homes coming back on the market, there’s no shortage of options to explore.

### **Key Questions to Ask Yourself (and Others):**

#### **For Sellers:**

	- If you were selling a home in Canyon Country, would you say now is the time to sell or wait? Why?

	- Would you price aggressively to attract more buyers or hold firm and wait for the perfect offer?

#### **For Buyers:**

	- If your best friend asked if they should buy now or hold off, what would you tell them?

	- With price changes happening, do you think sellers are motivated enough to negotiate, or are they holding firm on pricing?

Share your thoughts in the comments or reach out to discuss your specific situation.

### **Interest Rates and Their Impact on Canyon Country Real Estate**

The current mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed loan is hovering around&nbsp;**7.5%**. While this is higher than the historic lows we saw a few years ago, it’s essential to put things into perspective:

	- **Affordability Matters:**&nbsp;High rates mean higher monthly payments, so buyers need to budget carefully. For a $700,000 home with 20% down, the principal and interest payment is approximately $3,900.

	- **Opportunity for Buyers:**&nbsp;Higher rates can reduce competition, giving buyers more negotiating power.

	- **Seller Strategies:**&nbsp;Offering concessions, such as rate buy-downs, can make your listing more attractive to buyers navigating affordability challenges.

#### **The Fed’s Role:**

While many expected rates to decrease following recent Federal Reserve meetings, this hasn’t materialized. The mortgage rate is influenced more by the 10-year bond market than the Fed’s adjustments. Understanding this dynamic is crucial when planning your next move.

### **The Dual Agency Debate: Is It Right for You?**

In California, dual agency—where one agent represents both the buyer and seller in a transaction—is legal. However, it’s banned in several U.S. states and Canada due to the potential conflicts of interest it creates.

#### **What to Consider:**

	- **Conflict of Interest:**&nbsp;A dual agent must remain neutral, which can limit their ability to advocate fully for either party.

	- **Transparency Concerns:**&nbsp;Buyers and sellers might feel underserved when their agent can’t prioritize their best interests.

	- **Alternative:**&nbsp;Hiring your own agent ensures you have a dedicated advocate, whether you’re buying or selling.

So, would you prefer one agent for both sides or separate agents? Let us know what you think!

### **Tips for Buyers in Canyon Country**

	- **Get Pre-Approved:**&nbsp;Sellers favor buyers who are financially ready to close the deal.

	- **Focus on Negotiation:**&nbsp;With many properties selling below list price, don’t shy away from making offers.

	- **Explore All Options:**&nbsp;Check out price-adjusted homes, back-on-market listings, and even expired or withdrawn properties.

### **Tips for Sellers in Canyon Country**

	- **Price it Right:**&nbsp;Homes priced competitively sell faster and attract more interest.

	- **Invest in Preparation:**&nbsp;From staging to minor repairs, a little effort goes a long way in appealing to buyers.

	- **Market Aggressively:**&nbsp;Partner with an experienced agent who knows how to position your property for maximum exposure.
