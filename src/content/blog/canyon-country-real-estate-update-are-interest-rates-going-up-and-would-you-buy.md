### **Interest Rates and Their Impact on Canyon Country Real Estate**

The current mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed loan is hovering around&nbsp;**7.5%**. While this is higher than the historic lows we saw a few years ago, it’s essential to put things into perspective:

In California, dual agency—where one agent represents both the buyer and seller in a transaction—is legal. However, it’s banned in several U.S. states and Canada due to the potential conflicts of interest it creates.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
