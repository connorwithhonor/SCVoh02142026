## **3. What Is a 1031 Exchange?**

A **1031 exchange** (also referred to as a **like-kind exchange**) is an IRS-sanctioned process allowing real estate investors to sell their property and reinvest the proceeds into a like-kind property—**deferring capital gains tax** on the sale. The “1031” refers to **Section 1031 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code**, which stipulates various rules and regulations for carrying out these transactions.

### **Key Benefits of a 1031 Exchange**:

It is important to note that 1031 exchanges are **not** limited to wealthy real estate moguls; any property owner with an **investment or business-use property** in Santa Clarita or beyond can explore this strategy if it aligns with their financial goals and abides by IRS guidelines.

The concept of deferring taxes on property swaps dates back to the early 20th century. Over time, **Section 1031** has evolved through various legislative acts, court rulings, and IRS clarifications. Originally, exchanges had to be **simultaneous**: the relinquished property sale and the replacement property purchase had to happen on the same day. Over the years, the IRS introduced **delayed exchanges**, which allowed more time between selling one asset and purchasing another, leading to the commonly used structure involving **Qualified Intermediaries**.

## **16. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**Q1. Can I do a 1031 exchange on my primary residence in Santa Clarita?**
A: Generally, **no**. The property must be held for **business or investment** purposes to qualify. Some exceptions exist if part of the home is rented out or you convert the property’s use prior to the exchange, but you must follow strict rules.

**Q2. How many properties can I identify during the 45-day period?**
