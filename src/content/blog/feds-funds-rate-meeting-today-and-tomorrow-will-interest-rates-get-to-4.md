Market Insights for Santa Clarita – 261-2024

Today, on day 261 of 2024, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve's meeting, where discussions may signal whether interest rates could fall further. As potential rate cuts loom, the question on everyone’s mind is: Will interest rates drop to 4%? Let’s dive into the current market dynamics, expert insights, and what this could mean for homebuyers and sellers in Santa Clarita.

#### **Current Interest Rate Landscape:**

As of today, the 261st day of 2024, mortgage rates for a 30-year fixed loan are averaging between **6.2% and 6.3%**. This slight dip is attributed to a cooling labor market and expectations surrounding potential Federal Reserve actions​(

[Norada Real Estate Investments](https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/mortgage-rates-predictions-for-september-and-october-2024/)

). While a rate drop to 4% seems unlikely in the near term, the ongoing trend toward lower rates is promising for those in the market.

#### **Factors Driving the Decrease in Interest Rates:**

Several key elements are influencing the recent movement in interest rates:

	- 
	**Labor Market Adjustments:** A cooler job market has eased wage pressures, which in turn slows inflation. Lower inflation typically supports lower interest rates, benefiting potential homebuyers​(

	[Norada Real Estate Investments](https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/mortgage-rates-predictions-for-september-and-october-2024/)

	).

	- 
	**Federal Reserve's Expected Rate Cuts:** The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a rate cut soon, which could further decrease borrowing costs. This anticipation has already contributed to the minor decline in mortgage rates​(

	[LendingTree](https://www.lendingtree.com/home/mortgage/rates/mortgage-interest-rates-forecast/)

	).

	- 
	**Global Economic Conditions:** Broader global economic factors, such as geopolitical tensions and market fluctuations, also impact U.S. interest rates. A weaker economic outlook often leads to lower rates as investors flock to stable assets like U.S. Treasury bonds​(

	[Norada Real Estate Investments](https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/housing-market-insights-predictions-september-2024/)

	).

#### **Expert Predictions on Mortgage Rates:**

Experts are cautiously optimistic about the future of mortgage rates:

	- 
	**Molly Boesel from CoreLogic** forecasts that rates might stabilize around the mid-6% range, which could provide relief to buyers discouraged by the previously high rates​(

	[Norada Real Estate Investments](https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/mortgage-rates-predictions-for-september-and-october-2024/)

	).

	- 
	**Ralph DiBugnara of Home Qualified** suggests that while rates might begin around 7%, much of this is already factored into the current market, potentially leading to less dramatic changes​(

	[Norada Real Estate Investments](https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/mortgage-rates-predictions-for-september-and-october-2024/)

	).

	- 
	**Odeta Kushi from First American** indicates that further rate decreases could occur if economic indicators continue to weaken. However, robust economic data might stabilize or slightly increase rates​(

	[Norada Real Estate Investments](https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/mortgage-rates-predictions-for-september-and-october-2024/)

	).

Predictions for the remainder of the year suggest that rates may settle between **6% and 6.5%** by October 2024​(

).

#### **Impact on the Santa Clarita Housing Market:**

A reduction in mortgage rates could influence the Santa Clarita real estate market in several ways:

	- 
	**Improved Affordability for Buyers:** Lower rates might enhance affordability, particularly for first-time buyers. Historically, September has been a more affordable month for purchasing, and with rates dipping below 6.5%, more buyers might enter the market​(

	[LendingTree](https://www.lendingtree.com/home/mortgage/rates/mortgage-interest-rates-forecast/)

	).

	- 
	**Continued Inventory Constraints:** Despite lower rates, the "mortgage rate lock-in" effect, where homeowners with low-rate mortgages are reluctant to sell, continues to limit the supply of homes​(

	[LendingTree](https://www.lendingtree.com/home/mortgage/rates/mortgage-interest-rates-forecast/)

	).

	- 
	**Moderated Home Price Growth:** While home prices have increased, the growth rate has slowed. Nationally, prices rose by 4.3% from July 2023 to July 2024, a slower pace than in previous years​(

	[Norada Real Estate Investments](https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/housing-market-insights-predictions-september-2024/)

	). In Santa Clarita, residential inventory is stable yet limited, with 537 properties currently available.

#### **Advice for Buyers and Sellers:**

For **buyers**, this could be a strategic moment to start exploring available properties. With mortgage rates potentially continuing to dip, it's crucial to partner with a knowledgeable local realtor to navigate the competitive market effectively.

For **sellers**, a rate cut could attract more buyers, potentially leading to quicker sales and better pricing. However, strategic pricing and effective marketing will remain vital due to the tight inventory.
