Today, on day 261 of 2024, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve's meeting, where discussions may signal whether interest rates could fall further. As potential rate cuts loom, the question on everyone’s mind is: Will interest rates drop to 4%? Let’s dive into the current market dynamics, expert insights, and what this could mean for homebuyers and sellers in Santa Clarita.

#### **Current Interest Rate Landscape:**

As of today, the 261st day of 2024, mortgage rates for a 30-year fixed loan are averaging between **6.2% and 6.3%**. This slight dip is attributed to a cooling labor market and expectations surrounding potential Federal Reserve actions​(

#### **Factors Driving the Decrease in Interest Rates:**

Several key elements are influencing the recent movement in interest rates:

#### **Expert Predictions on Mortgage Rates:**

Experts are cautiously optimistic about the future of mortgage rates:

Predictions for the remainder of the year suggest that rates may settle between **6% and 6.5%** by October 2024​(
