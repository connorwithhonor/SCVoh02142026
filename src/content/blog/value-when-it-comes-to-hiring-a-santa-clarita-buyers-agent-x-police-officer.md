I was reading a WSJ, Wall Street Journal article by Veronica Dagher, and she, as always, nailed it.

There was a quote by an attorney who is in a buyer's mood for real estate, he offered that he had not been able to find a real estate agent who was able to express their value or explain the contracts.

That is accurate. That seems to be one of the biggest stressors now among agents. While they seem to be attempting to use cheat codes to get homes sold and get buyers to use their services through clever marketing and some "slight of hand" changes, that won't last long.

*In this case, the up down left right, Konami Code, isn't going to work (wrap your mind around this one)*.

It's like motivation when it comes to me dropping over 135 pounds of fat. I did not need anyone to tell me to keep going. I did not need a single person telling me that I needed to do it for my health.

I saw my health deteriorating; I observed my fat self unable to bend over and reach his shoelaces, and I knew buying 64" waist pants at Walmart, which were cutting into my fat belly, was a&nbsp;place that wasn't going to end well. I was 365 pounds and over 55% body fat!

I was 52 and had been obese in my youth, teens, adult years, with only moments of being less fat. I had one of those frames what could carry a lot of fat and seem "big and muscular".

Oh, I was also a "suck it in" person, as my dad reinforced that to me in my youth as mom fed me low calorie snacks.&nbsp;

No one had tell me to do it. NO ONE.

So, as a real estate agent I bring that Fat to Fit Transformation and the experience gleaned by being a LAPD police officer, Motor Cop, Trainer of the Trainer, RADAR, Laser, SITS, HITS, Glock and .45 Transition instructor, to the real estate negotiation table.

I remember negotiating in situations that were life and death. I was not a hostage negotiator, but to get someone who does not want to go to jail to go to jail without fighting and to smile occassionally during the process, that requires skillful negotiation skills.

I bring those talents to real estate and that is where my value begins. Then you add on the thousands of real estate transactions I have closed, participated in&nbsp;and been a part of, plus add thousands of phone conversations, discussions, being a committee member at the Southland Regional Association of Realtors, plus being a Realtor since 1998, and ***you have value that exceeds the book smart realtor or 18 year old&nbsp;turned realtor, or later in life realizing that you don't have a job or have been serving your family needs and need a change type of realtor.![](https://idx-acnt-ihouseprd.b-cdn.net/AR1197716/file_manager/connor%20macivor%20teaching%20lapd.png?width=400&amp;height=300&amp;aspect_ratio=400%3A300)***

Talking someone into a set of handcuffs requires empathy and a lot of it. Educating&nbsp;a seller into paying a buyer's agent's commission in 2024 will require more than empathy. That requires a soft and calm, value driven approach where **I show the value in my real estate buyer** beyond what other agents are capable of.

In the future of Santa Clarita real estate, there will be sellers who are going to sell their homes themselves, as has been. There are going to be sellers who are going to continue to offer a buyer's agent a commission to bring a "well qualified" home buyer and where that home buyer has been completely vetted carrying with them the strongest approval letter and supportive documentation. Plus the offer presented will be crafted by a seasoned and knowledgeable agent who understands the importance of what a home seller wants and what they need to see from the thousands of previous contracts buyer's agents presented at the times when I was the seller's agent.

And the new sellers **will be not inline with offering any additional funds to compensate a buyer's representative**. Those home sellers will have their homes sold too. The differentating factors will be how much longer that will take, how much of a hit will they have when it comes to offering price, and what do the requests add up to within escrow from the buyer to the sellers. (repairs, credits, discounts, in lieu of items that seemingly come up and how those are dealt with by the seller)

I remember back in 2007 when the last real estate market collapsed and agents were scurrying around wondering what they are going to do. Some went out and sought employment elsewhere. Others, like me, dug in deep and always remembered that real estate is going to be bought and sold, it comes down to finding those sources and giving those clients, at that time, what they need and they will come to you in droves. I sought the banks who were selling off REO, Real Estate Owned, assets (foreclosures), Citi Bank was gracious enough to pick me up and train me!

When hiring a buyer's agent. Look at where they came from. Look at the value that their life experience has brought them. Yes, I'm in this business to make a living. While I was LAPD for 21 years, I became a reserve before I qualified for retirement to embark on my real estate business. That took guts and I don't regret it. I'm honorably retired - I did my 20 and don't have the pension, only the ID that I have to show for it.&nbsp;

I take my real estate career seriously. I work daily, all the day, on real estate. I digest the new inventory, I study the current local trends and translate those into real estate data that can be shared with my home buyers and home sellers.

I also publish books on the best ways to buy and sell real estate at a local Santa Clarita Level. I publish daily content, this blog and have a magnificent youtube channel with postings on instagram and followings on TikTok and LinkedIn.&nbsp;

Bottom line, I am positioned where people are searching for homes and showing up with my www.SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com site when real estate is talked about within the search engines as it pertains to Santa Clarita real estate.&nbsp;

I won't apologize for being direct. I know my heart and when I bought my first home in 1996 I was taken for a ride by the agent I selected. It could have been a ride into hell, but I was able to get it remedied. However, that was my entry into real estate - carrying with me the protective spirit I was born with and fulfilling a protective dream, as I did when I moved here from New Mexico at 21 to become a LAPD police officer. Oh, and I had my Alive Day, August 12, 1994 as a LAPD motor cop, crashed on the 110 freeway near Los Angeles's China Town.

You need to go with who you feel will best represent you.&nbsp; Once you meet with them "in person", you will see where the true value is.
