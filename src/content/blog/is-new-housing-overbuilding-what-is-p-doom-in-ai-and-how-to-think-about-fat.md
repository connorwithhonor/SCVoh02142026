# Is New housing overbuilding, What is P-Doom in AI?, and how to think about fat!

# Why Santa Clarita Real Estate Is Cooling (And How to Still Win Big in 2025)

**TL;DR**: Santa Clarita’s real estate market is cooling with 753 active listings, down from 810, as school season slows buyer demand. Mortgage rates might drop if the Fed cuts rates, but don’t hold your breath. New home inventory is high elsewhere, but not here—yet. AI is shaking things up, from smarter home searches to potential job market chaos. Meanwhile, fasting helped me drop 135 pounds, and it can help you conquer your goals too. Ready to buy, sell, or get fit? Call me at 661-888-4983 or visit [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/contact](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/contact) to connect with a first-responder-turned-Realtor who gets it done.

## The Santa Clarita Real Estate Scene: What’s Happening in August 2025?

Alright, folks, let’s cut through the noise and get to the meat of it. I’m Connor MacIvor, your no-nonsense, ex-LAPD, first-responder-turned-Realtor (CALDRE 01238257), and I’m here to break down the Santa Clarita real estate market as of August 29, 2025. As someone who’s navigated the streets and now the housing market, I’m all about strategy, solutions, and keeping it real—no fluff, no BS, just the truth with a side of Gen X sarcasm.

The market’s cooling off, and I’m not just talking about the weather. We’re sitting at 753 active listings in Santa Clarita Valley, down from 755 yesterday and a high of 810 a couple of weeks ago. Why the drop? Blame the kids. Okay, not really, but school’s back in session, and families are hitting the brakes on home shopping. It’s like they’ve traded open house tours for school supply runs. You can check the latest listings at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/active-listings) to see what’s still out there.

This slowdown isn’t a bad thing—it’s a chance. Fewer buyers mean less competition, and if you’ve got a sharp agent (like yours truly), you can snag a deal before the market heats up again. But let’s dive into the numbers, trends, and strategies to make sure you’re not left holding an overpriced offer or a stale listing.

### The Numbers: Santa Clarita’s Market Pulse

Here’s the snapshot from my daily show:

	- **753 active listings**: Down from 810, signaling a seasonal dip.

	- **76 new listings** this week: Fresh inventory is still trickling in.

	- **75 price changes**: Sellers are getting real, adjusting prices to move properties.

	- **17 back-on-market**: Deals fall through—opportunity knocks.

	- **36 active under contract**, **50 pending**, **50 closed**: The market’s still moving, just slower.

	- **13 expired**, **25 canceled**, **8 held**, **7 withdrawn**: Some sellers are throwing in the towel.

What does this mean? The market’s in a transitional phase. Buyers are pickier, and sellers are starting to sweat. If you’re a buyer, those canceled listings are gold—your agent can knock on doors and negotiate off-market deals. Check out [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/coming-soon-listings-entering-the-santa-clarita-home-market-0-21-days-10272024](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/coming-soon-listings-entering-the-santa-clarita-home-market-0-21-days-10272024) for properties about to hit the market. If you’re a seller, pricing right is critical. Overprice, and you’re stuck watching your listing collect dust. More on that later at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/pricing-your-home-too-high-maybe-the-reason-its-not-selling](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/pricing-your-home-too-high-maybe-the-reason-its-not-selling).

### Why the Slowdown? Kids, Rates, and Buyer Fatigue

School’s back, and parents are too busy wrangling homework to chase open houses. But it’s not just that. Buyers are tired. They’ve been battling for homes, losing bidding wars, or finding nothing that fits their dream list. Some are saying, “Screw it, we’ll wait for winter break or 2026.” Big mistake. The market doesn’t wait for you to get your act together.

Then there’s the Fed. Everyone’s holding their breath for a rate cut, which could nudge mortgage rates down. Check the latest at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/mortgage-rates-santa-clarita-real-estate](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/mortgage-rates-santa-clarita-real-estate). But don’t bet the farm on it. Even if rates drop, competition will spike, and you’ll be fighting off buyers like zombies in a B-movie. My advice? Get pre-approved now (see [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/getting-a-legitimate-lender-and-getting-pre-approved](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/getting-a-legitimate-lender-and-getting-pre-approved)) and strike while others are napping.

## Navigating the Market Like a Pro

As a former cop, I know strategy. On the streets, you don’t walk into a situation blind—you assess, plan, and execute. Same goes for real estate. Whether you’re buying or selling, here’s how to play the game smart.

### For Buyers: Be the Sniper, Not the Spray-and-Pray

If you’re hunting for a home in Santa Clarita, don’t be the buyer who throws offers at everything and hopes something sticks. That’s a rookie move, and you’ll end up frustrated or overpaying. Here’s the playbook:

	- **Get Pre-Approved First**: Know your budget. A lender will break down your monthly costs—mortgage, taxes, insurance, HOA if applicable. Don’t just guess what you can afford; get the numbers. Visit [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/items-you-need-when-applying-for-a-loan](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/items-you-need-when-applying-for-a-loan) for what you’ll need.

	- **Target Canceled Listings**: Those 25 canceled listings? They’re low-hanging fruit. A good agent (hint: me) can approach sellers directly, folder in hand, with your qualifications. It’s like showing up to a negotiation with a badge—people listen. Learn more at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/competing-for-the-same-home-against-the-same-agent](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/competing-for-the-same-home-against-the-same-agent).

	- **Sign a Buyer Agreement**: New rules mean you need a written agreement to even view homes in California. Don’t get caught off-guard. Read up at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/buyers-signing-contracts-to-just-view-homes-for-sale-is-now-mandatory](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/buyers-signing-contracts-to-just-view-homes-for-sale-is-now-mandatory).

	- **Consider New Construction**: Nationwide, new home inventory is at its highest since the Great Recession. Santa Clarita’s not there yet, but builders might start cutting prices if demand slows. Your agent should know their pricing trends and negotiate hard. Check [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/new-construction-properties-for-sale-in-santa-clarita-ca](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/new-construction-properties-for-sale-in-santa-clarita-ca) for options.

Pro tip: Don’t make major credit purchases while shopping for a home. That new Tesla can tank your loan approval. More on that at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-you-should-not-make-any-major-credit-purchases](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-you-should-not-make-any-major-credit-purchases).

### For Sellers: Price It Right or Sit Tight

Sellers, listen up. Pricing your home too high is like trying to sell a beat-up cruiser for Ferrari money—it ain’t happening. Those 75 price changes this week? Sellers are waking up to reality. Here’s how to sell fast and maximize your profit:

	- **Set the Right Price**: Use a comparative market analysis to price competitively. Overpricing leads to longer days on market and lower offers. Dive into pricing strategies at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/setting-the-price](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/setting-the-price).

	- **Offer Concessions**: Buyers love incentives—closing cost credits, repairs, or rate buydowns. Learn how to sweeten the deal at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/seller-concessions-explained-a-first-responder-realtors-guide-to-selling](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/seller-concessions-explained-a-first-responder-realtors-guide-to-selling).

	- **Stage for Success**: First impressions matter. A cluttered home screams “pass.” Get tips on staging at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/making-a-good-first-impression](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/making-a-good-first-impression).

	- **Work with a Local Expert**: Your agent needs to be part of the local board to market effectively. Zillow’s great for browsing, but it’s not local. Trust someone who knows Santa Clarita like the back of their hand. See why at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/your-realtor-needs-to-be-a-member-of-our-local-board-to-market-effectively](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/your-realtor-needs-to-be-a-member-of-our-local-board-to-market-effectively).

## The AI Factor: Game-Changer or Job-Killer?

Let’s shift gears to artificial intelligence, because it’s not just for sci-fi nerds anymore—it’s reshaping real estate and, frankly, the world. I’m not just a Realtor; I’m an AI growth architect (check out [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/artificial-intelligence-in-real-estate](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/artificial-intelligence-in-real-estate)). Here’s how AI’s playing a role and why you should care.

### AI in Real Estate: Your Secret Weapon

AI’s already changing how we buy and sell homes. My site, [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/), uses AI tools like NEO, a bot that helps you find listings faster than you can say “open house.” It’s like having a 24/7 assistant who doesn’t sleep or need coffee. Try it at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/i-used-artificial-intelligence-to-show-me-how-to-buy-a-house-and-this-is-it](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/i-used-artificial-intelligence-to-show-me-how-to-buy-a-house-and-this-is-it).

AI can also analyze market trends, predict price shifts, and even estimate closing costs. Want to know what a $1 million mortgage looks like after a rate cut? Check out [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/how-much-with-a-1-million-dollar-mortgage-cost-after-rates-are-cut](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/how-much-with-a-1-million-dollar-mortgage-cost-after-rates-are-cut). But it’s not perfect—AI’s only as good as the human steering it. That’s where I come in, blending tech with street-smarts.

### The Dark Side: AI and the Job Market

Now, let’s get real about AI’s broader impact. I mentioned PDoom—the probability of AI doom. Some say we’re 5-10 years from artificial general intelligence (AGI), where machines outsmart us in every way. By 2030, we could hit superintelligence, where AI’s smarter than every human combined. Sounds cool, until you realize it could replace jobs faster than you can say “unemployment line.”

I’m 56, no pension, no health insurance, just hustling like a lot of you. If AI takes over real estate tasks—valuations, showings, even negotiations—what happens to agents? Or truck drivers, accountants, you name it? The optimists say, “Retrain!” Yeah, tell that to a 55-year-old who’s spent decades mastering their craft. I’m not doom-and-gloom, but we need to think about this. Join my AI community at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/artificial-intelligence-truth-humanize-santa-clarita-daily](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/artificial-intelligence-truth-humanize-santa-clarita-daily) to stay ahead of the curve.

### The Singularity: Utopia or Apocalypse?

Here’s the wild part: some folks are calling AI the “God in the machine.” It’s rewriting its own code, getting exponentially smarter. By 2035, we might hit the singularity—a point where AI’s so advanced, we can’t predict what happens next. Cure cancer? Maybe. End humanity? Hopefully not. Either way, it’s coming fast. Curious? Dive deeper at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/artificial-intelligence-versus-human-how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-home](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/artificial-intelligence-versus-human-how-much-does-it-cost-to-buy-a-home).

## From Fat to Fit: My 135-Pound Transformation and How It Relates

Alright, let’s talk about something personal: dropping 135 pounds at 52. I was a mess—365 pounds, eating 14 tacos and two milkshakes like it was a Tuesday ritual. Sound familiar? Maybe not the tacos, but the autopilot eating. Fasting changed my life, and it can change yours too. It’s not just about weight—it’s about discipline, which applies to real estate, AI, and everything else.

### Fasting 101: The No-BS Guide

Fasting isn’t starving yourself; it’s giving your body a break. I do 5-day fasts, refeed with protein and fats, and repeat. No carbs, no sugar—they’re my kryptonite. Here’s how to start:

	- **Pick Your Strongest Time**: If mornings are your jam, skip breakfast. Evenings? Skip dinner. Start small—16 hours without food.

	- **Check Labels**: Ketchup’s a sugar bomb. Mustard or mayo? Usually better. See [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/unlock-the-secret-to-my-fat-to-fit-transformation-the-truth-about-fasting](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/unlock-the-secret-to-my-fat-to-fit-transformation-the-truth-about-fasting) for more.

	- **Talk to Your Doc**: Especially if you’re on meds. Safety first.

	- **Plan Your Day**: Like a real estate deal, success comes from planning. Decide what you’ll eat (meat, eggs, fish) and stick to it.

### Discipline = Success

Losing fat taught me something: you need more good days than bad ones. Same with buying a home. You don’t win by half-assing offers or skipping due diligence. You plan, execute, and stay consistent. Want to know how I apply this to real estate? Check out [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/build-a-plan-of-action-and-get-ready](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/build-a-plan-of-action-and-get-ready).

## Why Work with a First Responder Realtor?

I’ve been in high-stakes situations—LAPD motor cop, firearms instructor, drug recognition expert. That’s not just a resume; it’s proof I handle pressure and solve problems. In real estate, I’m your strategist, not some slick-talking agent who’s all hat and no cattle. Here’s why I’m different:

	- **I Listen**: Too many agents talk over you. I hear your needs and deliver. See [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/is-your-agent-talking-too-much-and-not-listening-to-you-first-responder-agent](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/is-your-agent-talking-too-much-and-not-listening-to-you-first-responder-agent).

	- **I Negotiate**: Whether it’s a canceled listing or a new build, I fight for your deal. Learn more at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/negotiating-written-buyer-agreements-how-the-first-responder-realtor-protects](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/negotiating-written-buyer-agreements-how-the-first-responder-realtor-protects).

	- **I Know the Market**: From Valencia to Saugus, I’ve got the pulse. Check local trends at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-market-report](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/santa-clarita-market-report).

	- **I’m Honest**: No bait-and-switch. I’ve helped divorce attorneys and veterans navigate tricky deals. See why at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-attorneys-choose-me-for-their-clients-real-estate-needs-during-divorce](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/why-attorneys-choose-me-for-their-clients-real-estate-needs-during-divorce).

## What’s Next for Santa Clarita in 2025?

The market’s cooling, but it’s not crashing. Inventory’s down, but new listings are still hitting. AI’s making waves, and fasting’s keeping me sharp. Whether you’re buying, selling, or just curious, now’s the time to act. Mortgage rates might drop (track them at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/mortgage-rates-continue-to-shrink-closer-to-the-magic-number](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/mortgage-rates-continue-to-shrink-closer-to-the-magic-number)), but waiting could mean missing out. And if you’re looking to transform your life—body or home—I’m your guy.

**Recap**:

	- Santa Clarita’s market has 753 active listings, down from 810, due to school season and buyer fatigue.

	- Buyers: Get pre-approved, target canceled listings, and sign a buyer agreement to view homes.

	- Sellers: Price right, offer concessions, and stage well to sell fast.

	- AI’s revolutionizing real estate but could disrupt jobs—stay informed.

	- Fasting helped me lose 135 pounds; discipline is key in life and real estate.

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.
