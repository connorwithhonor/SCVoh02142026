**Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Update | Day 286 of 2024 | First Responder Realtor Connor with Honor**

Good morning, everyone! It’s *Connor with Honor*, your **First Responder Realtor**, here to bring you the latest update on the Santa Clarita Real Estate Market for **October 12th, 2024**, the 286th day of the year. As always, my goal is to keep you informed and ahead of the curve, whether you’re buying, selling, or just keeping an eye on the market.

Today, I want to dive deep into the **Santa Clarita real estate inventory**, some significant **market movements**, and what we can expect in the coming days. I'll also be hosting an open house in Valencia on **Balsam Court** from **11 AM to 4 PM**—so feel free to drop by, say hello, and ask any questions you have about real estate or the local market.

Let’s get into the numbers that have shaped the last 7 days:

That brings the **total active residential listings** in Santa Clarita across all categories to **543 properties**. With such a wide variety of homes available, now is an excellent time to explore the market. If you’re thinking of buying or selling, you want to stay informed and move strategically. Check out **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com**, my personal platform where you can access **unlocked, real-time inventory** of all homes in the area. If there’s ever an issue, just reach out to me, and I’ll make sure everything is sorted.

### What’s happening with federal mortgage changes?

As a former first responder, I know the importance of preparation and always having a backup plan. This principle has carried over into my real estate career, especially when advising clients on big decisions like mortgage strategies. Recent federal mortgage changes are getting attention, but developers aren’t overly optimistic that these adjustments will drive a significant demand for newly constructed homes. Supply issues persist, and preconstruction prices remain higher than the prices of existing homes, making it difficult for builders to meet buyer demand quickly enough.

While **longer amortization periods** (now stretching to 30 years) may offer some relief by lowering monthly payments, the long-term effects—especially with rising interest rates—need to be carefully considered. The key is to find balance. As your *First Responder Realtor*, I guide my clients through this complex landscape just like I did when I was out protecting our community—calm, prepared, and with your best interest at heart.

Whether you’re a first-time buyer, investor, or seasoned seller, **having a plan and strategy** is critical. The rules may change, but my mission remains the same: **keeping you safe** and guiding you through every step of your real estate journey. Just like when I was on the force, I make sure there’s a plan in place before you take action, ensuring you make the most informed and protected decisions.

### Open Houses and the Current Market Activity

I’m hosting an **open house** today in **Valencia** at **Balsam Court** from **11 AM to 4 PM**, but that’s just one of over **128 open houses** happening this weekend! Yesterday, we had over **100 open houses**, and today the numbers are even stronger. If you’re in the market, there’s no better time to come out and explore what Santa Clarita has to offer. Homes across all price ranges are available, and if you want to get the most accurate and up-to-date details on any property, head over to **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com**—it’s your one-stop shop for every listing, complete with photos, property details, and open house schedules.

I make it easy to stay updated on the local market. Every day, I post detailed reports so you can follow **market trends**, see what’s happening, and even predict where the market might be headed. All my updates are archived on **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com**, so you can look back and see how the market has shifted over time. This allows you to plan strategically for your future real estate moves, just like how I’d prepare for any operation back in my first responder days—**knowledge is power**.

### What to Watch for Moving Forward

Buyers are watching mortgage rates and home availability closely, and while there’s plenty of movement in the market, there are still challenges, especially in new construction. Rising **borrowing costs** and **supply chain issues** are slowing down the pace of new builds, which means buyers have to be strategic about their choices.

If you're looking for **expert guidance** to navigate the market, whether buying, selling, or investing, I’m here for you. With the background of a first responder, I bring **discipline, preparedness, and integrity** to every transaction. I treat real estate the way I treated my duty as a public servant—committed to doing what’s best for the people I serve.

If you're looking to buy or sell real estate in Santa Clarita, remember that **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com** is where you'll find all the current listings, including those that are coming soon and back on the market. Keep an eye out for any changes in the market and be sure to stay in touch for the latest updates.

Thank you for joining me today! I’m **Connor with Honor**, your **First Responder Realtor**, and I look forward to helping you make informed, smart decisions in this dynamic real estate market. Until next time, stay safe and keep watching the market.
