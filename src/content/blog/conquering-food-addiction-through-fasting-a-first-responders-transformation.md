### Introduction: The Grip of Food Addiction

Fast food is engineered to keep you hooked. Those curly fries, milkshakes, and double cheeseburgers are designed to pull you back for more. I’ve been there, stuck in a drive-through rut, hiding in parking lots to devour 12 tacos or a stack of burgers. It’s not just hunger—it’s an autopilot process, often triggered by boredom, stress, or habit. If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Food addiction is a battle many face, but it’s one you can win.

I’m Connor MacIvor, a former LAPD motor cop, firearms instructor, and now a realtor (CALDRE 01238257) and body transformation specialist. At my heaviest, I was 365 pounds, battling health issues and fed up with doctor visits. At 52, I decided enough was enough. Through fasting, I dropped 135 pounds in 7.5 months, going from 365 to 230 pounds. My longest fast was 14 days. This post shares how I broke free from food addiction and how you can too. Let’s get into the raw truth about food addiction, the power of fasting, and the steps to take control of your health.

### The Reality of Food Addiction

Food addiction isn’t just loving food—it’s a cycle of craving, indulgence, and regret. I used to find myself in fast food parking lots, scarfing down meals I barely tasted, driven by an urge I couldn’t explain. Whether it was 14 tacos at a local chain or several McDonald’s double cheeseburgers with large fries and milkshakes, the pattern was the same: eat, hide, repeat.

Here’s why food addiction is so tough:

	- **Engineered to Crave**: Fast food is crafted to hit your brain’s reward centers. High sugar, fat, and salt combinations trigger dopamine, making you want more. It’s not your fault—it’s science.

	- **Emotional Triggers**: Boredom, stress, or a rough day can send you straight to the drive-through. I’d convince myself I had nothing to do, and suddenly, I was eating enough for three people.

	- **Autopilot Eating**: Eating becomes a reflex, not a choice. You’re not even hungry—just reaching for the next bite.

	- **The Shame Spiral**: After a parking lot binge, the guilt hits hard. You promise yourself, “This time will be different,” but the cycle repeats.

If you’re stuck in this loop, know this: you’re not weak, and you’re not alone. Food addiction is real, but it’s not unbeatable. My turning point came when I was tired of being sick and tired. I was done with doctor visits, medications, and feeling trapped in my own body. That’s when I discovered fasting—a tool that helped me reset my relationship with food.

### How Fasting Changed My Life

At 52, I hit rock bottom. At 365 pounds, I was battling health issues and fed up with the status quo. I’d tried diets—low-carb, keto, you name it—but nothing stuck. Then I found fasting. Not the trendy “skip breakfast” kind, but extended fasting that rewired my body and mind. Here’s how it worked for me and why it might work for you.

#### The Science of Fasting

Fasting isn’t just about not eating—it’s about giving your body a break to reset. Here’s what happens when you fast:

	- **Insulin Regulation**: Foods high in carbs and sugars spike insulin, which signals your body to store fat. Fasting lowers insulin levels, allowing your body to burn stored fat for energy. This is why I could go 14 days without food—my body had plenty of fat to burn.

	- **Autophagy**: After 12-16 hours of fasting, your body enters autophagy, a process where it cleans out damaged cells and regenerates new ones. This is like a reset button for your health.

	- **Mental Clarity**: Hunger is tough at first, but once you push through, you gain focus and clarity. I found myself sharper and less controlled by cravings.

	- **Breaking the Addiction Cycle**: Fasting forces you to confront hunger head-on. You realize you won’t die if you miss a meal or two, which is key to breaking food addiction.

#### My Fasting Journey

I started small, skipping a meal here and there. The first few days were rough—hunger pangs, irritability, the works. But I learned hunger comes in waves, and if you ride them out, they pass. Over time, I extended my fasts:

	- **16:8 Intermittent Fasting**: I ate within an 8-hour window and fasted for 16 hours. This was my gateway to longer fasts.

	- **24-Hour Fasts**: I’d go a full day without food, drinking only water, black coffee, or unsweetened tea. This built my confidence.

	- **Extended Fasts**: My longest was 14 days, burning fat and resetting insulin sensitivity. I checked with my doctor first, especially since I was on medications.

The result? I dropped 135 pounds in 7.5 months, going from 365 to 230 pounds. More importantly, I broke free from the drive-through diet. I stopped hiding in parking lots and started living with purpose.

### Practical Tips to Combat Food Addiction with Fasting

Ready to take control? Here’s how to start fasting and break the cycle of food addiction:

	- **Start Small**: Try a 12-hour fast overnight (e.g., stop eating at 8 PM, eat again at 8 AM). Gradually extend to 16:8 or 24-hour fasts.

	- **Stay Hydrated**: Drink water, black coffee, or unsweetened tea during fasts. It curbs hunger and keeps you energized.

	- **Consult Your Doctor**: If you’re on medications or have health conditions, check with your doctor before fasting. Safety first.

	- **Address Emotional Triggers**: Identify what drives you to eat—boredom, stress, or habit. Replace eating with activities like walking, reading, or journaling.

	- **Forgive Yourself**: Slip-ups happen. If you break a fast or binge, don’t dwell on it. Acknowledge it, learn, and move forward.

	- **Track Your Progress**: Use a journal or app to log fasts, weight, and how you feel. Seeing progress keeps you motivated.

	- **Learn About Insulin**: Understand how carbs and sugars spike insulin, leading to fat storage. Fasting helps reset this cycle, but knowledge is power.

### The Mental Battle: Overcoming the Hunger Dilemma

Fasting is as much a mental game as a physical one. The first few days, your brain screams, “Eat!” But hunger is temporary. It’s a wave, not a tsunami. Here’s how I tackled the mental side:

	- **Reframe Hunger**: I told myself, “This is my body burning fat.” Hunger became a sign of progress, not pain.

	- **Distraction is Key**: When cravings hit, I’d go for a walk, call a friend, or focus on work. As a realtor, I’d dive into helping clients find their dream home at [https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/dream-home-finder](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/dream-home-finder).

	- **Self-Forgiveness**: I had days where I caved and ate a burger. Instead of spiraling, I forgave myself and got back on track.

	- **Visualize the Goal**: I pictured myself at 230 pounds, healthy and active. That vision kept me going.

### Why Fasting Works for Food Addiction

Fasting isn’t a quick fix—it’s a lifestyle shift. Here’s why it’s effective for breaking food addiction:

	- **Breaks the Cycle**: Fasting pauses autopilot eating, giving you a chance to reset.

	- **Reduces Cravings**: Over time, fasting lowers insulin and retrains your brain to crave less sugar and carbs.

	- **Builds Discipline**: Each fast strengthens willpower, making it easier to say no to unhealthy foods.

	- **Improves Health**: Beyond weight loss, fasting improves insulin sensitivity, reduces inflammation, and boosts energy.
