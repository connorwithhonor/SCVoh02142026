### Introduction: The Grip of Food Addiction

Fast food is engineered to keep you hooked. Those curly fries, milkshakes, and double cheeseburgers are designed to pull you back for more. I’ve been there, stuck in a drive-through rut, hiding in parking lots to devour 12 tacos or a stack of burgers. It’s not just hunger—it’s an autopilot process, often triggered by boredom, stress, or habit. If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Food addiction is a battle many face, but it’s one you can win.

I’m Connor MacIvor, a former LAPD motor cop, firearms instructor, and now a realtor (CALDRE 01238257) and body transformation specialist. At my heaviest, I was 365 pounds, battling health issues and fed up with doctor visits. At 52, I decided enough was enough. Through fasting, I dropped 135 pounds in 7.5 months, going from 365 to 230 pounds. My longest fast was 14 days. This post shares how I broke free from food addiction and how you can too. Let’s get into the raw truth about food addiction, the power of fasting, and the steps to take control of your health.

### The Reality of Food Addiction

Food addiction isn’t just loving food—it’s a cycle of craving, indulgence, and regret. I used to find myself in fast food parking lots, scarfing down meals I barely tasted, driven by an urge I couldn’t explain. Whether it was 14 tacos at a local chain or several McDonald’s double cheeseburgers with large fries and milkshakes, the pattern was the same: eat, hide, repeat.

Here’s why food addiction is so tough:

If you’re stuck in this loop, know this: you’re not weak, and you’re not alone. Food addiction is real, but it’s not unbeatable. My turning point came when I was tired of being sick and tired. I was done with doctor visits, medications, and feeling trapped in my own body. That’s when I discovered fasting—a tool that helped me reset my relationship with food.

### How Fasting Changed My Life

At 52, I hit rock bottom. At 365 pounds, I was battling health issues and fed up with the status quo. I’d tried diets—low-carb, keto, you name it—but nothing stuck. Then I found fasting. Not the trendy “skip breakfast” kind, but extended fasting that rewired my body and mind. Here’s how it worked for me and why it might work for you.

#### The Science of Fasting

Fasting isn’t just about not eating—it’s about giving your body a break to reset. Here’s what happens when you fast:

#### My Fasting Journey

I started small, skipping a meal here and there. The first few days were rough—hunger pangs, irritability, the works. But I learned hunger comes in waves, and if you ride them out, they pass. Over time, I extended my fasts:

The result? I dropped 135 pounds in 7.5 months, going from 365 to 230 pounds. More importantly, I broke free from the drive-through diet. I stopped hiding in parking lots and started living with purpose.
