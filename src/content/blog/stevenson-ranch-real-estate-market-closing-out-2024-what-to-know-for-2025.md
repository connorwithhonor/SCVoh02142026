### Key Considerations for Sellers

	- 
	**Pricing Strategies**:

	Homes in Stevenson Ranch are selling close to their list prices, but pricing too aggressively can result in extended time on the market.

	
		**Competitive Pricing**: This strategy generates multiple offers, potentially driving the sale price above the listing price.

		- **Market-Based Pricing**: Listing the property at or near market value ensures steady buyer interest.

	

	
	- 
	**Staging and Presentation**:

	With the high level of competition, professional staging and high-quality photography can significantly enhance your property’s appeal.

	

	- 
	**Seller Concessions**:

	Offering incentives like closing cost assistance or flexible move-in dates can make your home more attractive to buyers.

	

### Navigating Buyer-Broker Agreements

As of January 1, 2025, California law mandates that buyers sign a buyer-broker agreement before engaging with a real estate agent. This agreement formalizes the relationship between buyers and their agents, outlining key terms such as commission, exclusivity, and duration. If you’re preparing to buy, make sure you understand this agreement fully before signing. Learn more about this critical change at [Santa Clarita Open Houses](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com).
