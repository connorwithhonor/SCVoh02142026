Welcome to our in-depth look at the **Santa Clarita Valley real estate market** for September 2024. Whether you're a potential buyer, seller, or just keeping an eye on market trends, this update provides valuable insights into the current state of the SCV housing market. Let’s break down the numbers, key trends, and what they mean for you!

### **Residential Active Inventory: Steady Supply with Price Adjustments**

As of this month, the **Santa Clarita Valley residential market** features **650 active listings**, offering a balanced selection for buyers. This inventory reflects a market where homes are staying on the market for an average of **55 days**, giving buyers a bit more breathing room compared to the ultra-competitive market we've seen in previous years.

	- 
	**New Listings**: We’ve seen **303 new homes** come onto the market in September. This fresh inventory offers potential buyers a range of new choices, from starter homes to luxury properties.

	

	- 
	**Average &amp; Median List Price**: The **average list price** for active homes is sitting at **$941,100**, while the **median list price** comes in at **$835,000**. These numbers suggest that while prices remain high, there's a healthy mix of price points, catering to different buyer needs.

	

	- 
	**Price Adjustments**: It's worth noting that **62 properties** have seen **price changes** this month. This signals that some sellers are adjusting their expectations to meet current market demands. Whether you’re a buyer or seller, this could be an opportunity to reevaluate your strategy.

	

### **Pending and Closed Sales: Steady Demand Despite Market Shifts**

While the active inventory remains steady, the **pending and closed sales** data gives us a clearer picture of how buyers are responding to market conditions.

	- 
	**Pending Sales**: This month, **167 new escrows** were opened, adding to the **year-to-date total of 2,110 pending escrows**. Homes are moving relatively quickly, with **pending properties** averaging just **39 days** on the market. The **average list price** for these pending sales is around **$838,000**, showing that demand remains strong, especially in the higher-end market.

	

	- 
	**Closed Sales**: In September, we saw **226 homes close escrow**, contributing to the **2,011 total closed sales** so far this year. The **total volume of sales** for the month amounted to **$185.15 million**, with an **average sale price** of **$819,200** and a **median sale price** of **$800,000**. These figures highlight the continued buyer demand, with many homes still selling at or near list price.

	Additionally, **60.2% of sales** closed at their **list price**, and **90.7% of all sales** were **cooperative** transactions between buyer and seller agents, indicating a smooth process for most involved.

	

### **Market Trends and What They Mean for Buyers and Sellers**

The Santa Clarita Valley housing market remains **healthy and balanced**, but there are several key trends to watch, whether you’re buying or selling.

#### **For Buyers**:

	- 
	**Opportunities in Price Adjustments**: With **62 properties adjusting prices** this month, there may be room for negotiation, especially on homes that have been on the market for a while. Buyers should also keep an eye on the **23 properties that came back on the market** after falling out of escrow, as these homes might offer additional opportunities.

	

	- 
	**New Listings to Watch**: With **303 new listings**, the market is constantly shifting, so it's important to stay informed and be ready to act quickly if you find a home that fits your needs.

	

	- 
	**Competitive Sales**: Although **price changes** are happening, homes are still closing at list price **60.2% of the time**, and the average days on the market for closed sales are just **34 days**. This means well-priced homes are still moving fast, so it’s crucial to be prepared when making an offer.

	

#### **For Sellers**:

	- 
	**Market Timing is Key**: The average time on market for active listings is **55 days**, and those that move to pending status are taking **39 days** to sell. Pricing your home competitively from the start can help you sell faster and avoid lingering on the market.

	

	- 
	**Price Sensitivity**: With more than **60% of sales** closing at list price, it's clear that buyers are willing to meet asking prices when the home is priced right. However, the **62 price changes** this month indicate that sellers who overprice may need to adjust to align with buyer expectations.

	

	- 
	**Market Saturation**: The current active inventory of **650 homes** is enough to provide buyers with options, but not so much that sellers should feel worried about oversupply. It’s still a seller’s market in many price ranges, but pricing and presentation will be key to standing out.

	

### **Other Key Market Stats: September 2024**

Here are a few additional figures to keep in mind when considering the SCV real estate market this month:

	- 
	**Back on Market**: **23 homes** that were previously under contract have returned to the market. These homes may present unique opportunities for buyers, particularly if they fell out of escrow due to financing or inspection issues.

	

	- 
	**Expired Listings**: **7 homes** expired without selling, which typically occurs when homes are priced too high or not marketed effectively.

	

	- 
	**Canceled Listings**: **12 listings** were canceled, which could mean the sellers have decided to wait for better market conditions or reassess their selling strategy.

	

	- 
	**Hold and Withdrawn Listings**: **11 properties** are on hold, and **0 were withdrawn**, which means some sellers are temporarily pausing their listings, possibly to make improvements or wait for more favorable conditions.

**Santa Clarita Valley Real Estate Market Watch – September 2024**

Welcome to today’s **Santa Clarita Valley Real Estate Market Watch** for September 2024! Let’s dive into the most recent activity shaping our local market. Whether you're a potential buyer, seller, or just curious about the state of real estate, this detailed breakdown will help you understand what’s going on in the Santa Clarita Valley.

### **Coming Soon Listings**

Currently, **14 properties** are set to hit the market in the next 21 days. Whether it’s tomorrow or three weeks from now depends on each seller's strategy. If you're actively looking to buy, keeping an eye on these upcoming listings is crucial. The best way to do this is to team up with a local agent who can set up a search for you. This ensures you'll be alerted as soon as these listings are live.

### **New Listings**

In the last week, **84 new homes** were listed for sale. These fresh listings offer buyers more variety and options to choose from. Whether you're looking for a starter home, a luxury property, or something in between, there’s a wide range of homes hitting the market right now.

### **Price Changes**

There have been **62 price adjustments** over the past seven days. This typically indicates that sellers are either eager to attract offers or adjusting their expectations based on current market conditions. For buyers, this can be an excellent opportunity to find a deal or negotiate a better price.

### **Back on Market**

**23 homes** that were previously under contract have returned to the market. This happens for various reasons, such as financing falling through or inspection issues. If you missed out on a home earlier, this category offers you a second chance to make a move on a property.

### **Active Under Contract**

There are **33 properties** currently in the final stages before closing, further highlighting the high demand for well-priced homes. Homes in this category have accepted offers and are on the path to closing escrow.

### **Pending Sales**

Currently, **48 homes** are in escrow, showing that the market remains active with serious buyers. These pending transactions are strong indicators that demand is still robust, despite any shifts we’ve seen in the broader market.

### **Closed Sales**

In the last seven days, **57 homes** have successfully closed escrow. These properties are now officially sold, and the buyers are settling into their new homes. This steady stream of closed sales highlights the ongoing movement in the Santa Clarita real estate market.

### **Expired and Canceled Listings**

There were **7 expired listings** in the last week. These homes were removed from the market after not selling within the listing period. Additionally, **12 listings were canceled**, meaning the sellers decided to pull their homes off the market. This could indicate a shift in their plans or a reconsideration of their selling strategy.

### **Hold Listings**

**11 properties** were placed on hold, meaning they are temporarily off the market but may be re-listed soon. Sellers may be making improvements, waiting for better market conditions, or simply taking a break from the process.

### **No Withdrawn Listings**

It’s worth noting that **no listings** were fully withdrawn from the market this week, meaning there haven’t been any homes taken off the market permanently.

### **What This Means for Buyers and Sellers**

#### **For Buyers:**

The market remains competitive, but there are still opportunities to find the right home. Pay close attention to the **Back on Market** and **Price Change** categories, as these homes may offer some flexibility when it comes to negotiations. Sellers who have recently adjusted their prices or had deals fall through may be more open to working with buyers.

Additionally, with the **14 Coming Soon listings**, there will be fresh inventory available soon, so staying in close contact with your agent can give you an edge.

#### **For Sellers:**

Demand continues to be strong, but it’s important to ensure your home is priced correctly from the start. Homes that are priced competitively are moving quickly, as we can see from the high number of homes going **under contract** and the relatively short **days on market** for closed sales. If you price too high initially, you may end up needing a price reduction, which could mean your home sits on the market longer than necessary.

### **Open Houses: The Insider's Guide**

For those of you planning to check out **open houses** this weekend, we’ve got **59 scheduled** in Santa Clarita. That number is fluid and could change as some homes accept offers and are removed from the open house schedule. You can always check for updates on my website, **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com**.

If you prefer to keep things low-key when attending open houses, remember this tip: you can inform the listing agent that you’re already represented by a buyer's agent. This will typically allow you to tour the home without being bombarded by questions or a sales pitch. However, don’t hesitate to ask about important aspects like the condition of the plumbing, roof, electrical systems, or HVAC. These are critical factors to consider when evaluating a potential home.

### **Delayed Gratification: A Real Estate Perspective**

Buying real estate is a long-term investment. The concept of **delayed gratification** plays a significant role here. For buyers, especially first-time homeowners, the real rewards of homeownership—whether it’s equity growth, tax advantages, or just having a place to call your own—often don’t materialize until years down the road.

If you take care of your property, keep up with mortgage payments, and occasionally invest in improvements, you could see substantial appreciation over time. It’s not uncommon for homeowners who purchased in their 20s or 30s to see their property values double or even triple after 10-15 years. This creates leverage for future investments or retirement.

However, you need to be patient. Real estate doesn’t offer the fast returns that riskier investments do. But if you play the long game, the rewards can be significant.

### **A Look Back at the Market Cycles**

It’s always helpful to look at history to understand where the market might be headed. Back in 2007, the housing market collapsed due to the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to a significant downturn in home values. But by late 2011 and early 2012, the market hit bottom, and since then, we’ve seen consistent growth.

Today, prices are higher than ever before, and while it’s impossible to predict when the next cycle will shift, we know that real estate remains one of the most stable long-term investments. Waiting for the perfect market conditions to buy could mean missing out on years of appreciation. Instead, focus on purchasing within your means and preparing for the long-term.

That wraps up today’s **Santa Clarita Valley Market Watch** for September 2024. Whether you’re thinking of buying or selling, I’m here to help you navigate this ever-changing market. If you have questions, need advice, or want a more personalized market report, feel free to reach out.
