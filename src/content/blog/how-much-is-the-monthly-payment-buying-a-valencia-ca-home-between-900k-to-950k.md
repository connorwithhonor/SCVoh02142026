Below is a long-form discussion—aiming for approximately 3,000 words—describing current Valencia, CA properties in the $900,000 to $950,000 range, along with example mortgage calculations for three common financing scenarios (20% down conventional loan, 3.5% down FHA loan, and a VA loan). We’ll also note various property features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, subdivision or area, and monthly HOA dues (where applicable). Please remember all figures stated here are estimates only and can change based on a wide range of factors, including your creditworthiness, down payment amount, exact interest rates, and other individual qualifications. The goal is to provide general insight into the real estate landscape in Valencia, California, specifically around the $900k–$950k price band. For the most up-to-date listings and details, visit SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/valencia-homes. I’m Connor with Honor—let’s get started!

## Introduction and Overview

Valencia is one of the most popular neighborhoods within the Santa Clarita Valley. Known for award-winning schools, abundant parks, gorgeous paseos, and well-maintained communities, Valencia boasts an enviable suburban lifestyle. Buyers seeking homes around $900,000 to $950,000 typically discover an array of single-family residences, each with their own unique charm, floor plans, and, in many cases, homeowner association (HOA) amenities.

Whether you’re a first-time buyer or a seasoned homeowner transitioning to a new property, it’s always important to know what your monthly payment might look like and what each community has to offer. Many factors affect these numbers. Interest rates are top of mind, but you should also account for local property taxes (commonly estimated around 1% to 1.25% of the purchase price in much of California, though it varies), homeowners insurance, any mortgage insurance if the down payment is below 20%, and HOA dues. Together, these create your total “monthly carrying cost,” which is effectively the cost of ownership beyond just principal and interest on the mortgage.

Below, you’ll find (1) a discussion of example monthly payments at a hypothetical interest rate based on a current Bankrate average (we’ve assumed around 6.75% for a 30-year fixed, just for illustration), (2) a sampling of Valencia’s 900k–950k listings with summarized attributes such as beds, baths, community or subdivision name, and approximate HOA fees if known, and (3) disclaimers regarding the nature of these estimates and the need for further individualized analysis.

## Example Monthly Mortgage Payments

Before reviewing the properties themselves, let’s look at three popular loan scenarios for a $900,000 purchase price in Valencia. Keep in mind, many of these properties also include an HOA—some around $59 per month, others up to $212 per month, or even more, depending on the community. As an example, let’s assume $100 per month in HOA dues as an “average” figure. Actual properties differ.

### 1. Conventional Loan with 20% Down

	- 
	**Purchase Price:** $900,000

	

	- 
	**Down Payment (20%):** $180,000

	

	- 
	**Loan Amount:** $720,000

	

	- 
	**Interest Rate (Approx.):** 6.75% (subject to change daily, used here for example purposes)

	

	- 
	**Term:** 30 years

	

	- 
	**Monthly Principal &amp; Interest:** Approximately $4,670

	

	- 
	**Estimated HOA:** $100

	

	- 
	**Total (Excluding Taxes &amp; Insurance):** Around $4,770

	

For buyers who can put down 20%, private mortgage insurance (PMI) is typically not required, which helps keep the monthly mortgage portion of your payment lower compared to low-down-payment programs. Of course, property taxes and homeowner’s insurance must be considered; for a $900,000 home, property taxes can easily approach $800 to $1,000 per month, depending on the local tax rate. Insurance could be another $75 to $150 per month, varying by provider and coverage. Adding those to your principal and interest estimate will move the monthly total up further.

### 2. FHA Loan with 3.5% Down

	- 
	**Purchase Price:** $900,000

	

	- 
	**Down Payment (3.5%):** $31,500

	

	- 
	**Loan Amount:** $868,500

	

	- 
	**Interest Rate (Approx.):** 6.75% (varies daily)

	

	- 
	**Term:** 30 years

	

	- 
	**Monthly Principal &amp; Interest:** Approximately $5,633

	

	- 
	**Monthly Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP):** Varies (often ~0.85% of the loan per year, divided into 12 months)

	

	- 
	**Estimated HOA:** $100

	

	- 
	**Total (Excluding Taxes &amp; Insurance, but with MIP):** In the ballpark of $6,200 or more (because you must add that monthly mortgage insurance premium).

	

FHA loans are popular because of their lenient credit requirements, but they do come with mortgage insurance premiums both upfront and monthly. A typical monthly MIP might add an extra few hundred dollars. The exact amount depends on your loan specifics (including loan amount and duration). As with the conventional loan scenario, property tax and insurance are on top of that, plus the HOA.

### 3. VA Loan with 0% Down

	- 
	**Purchase Price:** $900,000

	

	- 
	**Down Payment:** $0

	

	- 
	**Loan Amount:** $900,000

	

	- 
	**Interest Rate (Approx.):** 6.75% (varies)

	

	- 
	**Term:** 30 years

	

	- 
	**Monthly Principal &amp; Interest:** Approximately $5,837

	

	- 
	**VA Funding Fee:** Varies by veteran eligibility, down payment (if any), and disability status

	

	- 
	**Estimated HOA:** $100

	

	- 
	**Total (Excluding Taxes &amp; Insurance):** Around $5,937 plus any monthly portion of funding fee (if financed).

	

VA loans typically do not require mortgage insurance, but most borrowers pay a VA funding fee (unless exempt). This fee can be financed into the loan, increasing the total principal owed, or paid in cash at closing. In turn, property taxes, insurance, and any HOA dues add on top of these estimates.

**Big Disclaimer:** The approximate monthly payments given above do *not* factor in property taxes, homeowners insurance, or specialized mortgage insurance for FHA (beyond a quick mention). They also don’t incorporate nuances like mortgage points, any variable interest rates, or exact underwriting guidelines. For a more accurate figure, contact a reputable lender or mortgage broker who can assess your personal credit profile, debt-to-income ratio, and down payment to generate a personalized loan estimate.

## Sampling of Valencia Listings ($900k–$950k Range)

## How These Listings Align with Monthly Payments

When you see list prices around $900,000 to $950,000, the monthly mortgage cost for the typical 30-year fixed rate (if rates hover around 6% to 7%) can quickly exceed $4,500 to $5,000 in principal and interest alone for a conventional loan—even with a significant down payment. Once you factor in property tax, homeowners insurance, HOA fees, and (if applicable) mortgage insurance or solar lease, it’s not uncommon to be in the $5,500 to $6,500 range or more each month, depending on your chosen loan program and down payment.

For 55+ buyers looking into new construction at Tesoro Highlands or FivePoint Valencia, remember there may be additional costs such as Mello-Roos or special assessments that are fairly typical in brand-new master-planned communities. Always check the property’s tax record or have your agent confirm any such district fees.

## Important Disclaimers

	- 
	**Interest Rate Variability**
	Rates can change daily. A small shift from 6.75% to 7% or down to 6.5% can significantly alter your monthly payment. Always consult your lender for a current interest rate quote.

	

	- 
	**Loan Qualification**
	Your credit history, debt-to-income ratio, employment stability, and down payment amount all figure into your eligibility for any of these programs. “Advertised” rates often assume excellent credit (e.g., 740+ FICO) and a favorable debt-to-income ratio.

	

	- 
	**Mortgage Insurance**
	If you’re putting less than 20% down, expect either private mortgage insurance (PMI) on a conventional loan or mortgage insurance premium (MIP) on an FHA loan. VA loans for qualified veterans generally don’t require monthly mortgage insurance, but they do have a funding fee unless the borrower is exempt. These fees can substantially change your monthly outlay.

	

	- 
	**Property Taxes**
	The Santa Clarita Valley, like many parts of California, has property taxes that might be roughly 1% to 1.25% of the home’s assessed value—potentially more if there’s a Mello-Roos assessment. Always research the specific tax rate for the community you’re eyeing, as it can vary even within Valencia.

	

	- 
	**HOA Fees**
	The monthly dues for HOAs can differ widely—$59, $100, $200, or beyond—based on amenities, services covered, and age of the community. Always confirm whether the HOA dues indicated are up to date, and inquire if there are upcoming special assessments.

	

	- 
	**Special Assessments and Mello-Roos**
	In brand-new developments and some established neighborhoods, there may be Mello-Roos fees (an additional tax to finance infrastructure like schools, roads, etc.). Clarify if a property has these fees before making an offer, as it affects your monthly cost.

	

	- 
	**Exact Address Omission**
	In our quick reference above, we used partial street names. For the full property address, professional photos, and an in-depth look, visit SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com/valencia-homes, or get in touch with your trusted real estate professional.

	

	- 
	**No Guarantee of Current Availability**
	Listings change frequently. Some of the properties discussed here might be sold, withdrawn, or have price adjustments. For the most accurate, updated listing information, always consult a reliable home-search portal or your local REALTOR®.

	

## Additional Tips for Prospective Buyers

	- 
	**Get Pre-Approved:** Before you shop seriously for homes, meet with a lender to get a firm pre-approval. This step clarifies your budget and can strengthen any purchase offer you make, showing sellers you are prepared and qualified.

	

	- 
	**Assess All Costs:** Beyond the mortgage principal and interest, you’ll want a clear breakdown of property tax estimates, HOA dues, home insurance quotes, and any mortgage insurance. Don’t forget potential utilities, commuting costs, or lifestyle factors (e.g., if you need internet for remote work, or if the property has a pool requiring additional upkeep).

	

	- 
	**Inspect Thoroughly:** Once you’re in escrow, hire a professional home inspector to evaluate the property’s condition. Even brand-new constructions can have issues that need addressing, such as incomplete finishes or improperly installed hardware.

	

	- 
	**Consider Resale Value &amp; Lifestyle:** In well-established communities like Valencia, you’ll typically see steady demand, thanks to strong schools, location convenience, and great local amenities. Buying in a well-regarded area often means more stable home values in the long run. That said, weigh your personal goals: Are you looking for top-notch community recreation? A short commute to your workplace? A house with a large yard or no yard? Think about these carefully because they will affect your future satisfaction and eventual resale.

	

	- 
	**Local Market Dynamics:** The Santa Clarita Valley sometimes follows broader trends in Los Angeles County but can have its own localized fluctuations. Inventory levels, time on market, and competition from other buyers can shift from month to month. Work closely with a knowledgeable agent who monitors these micro-trends so you can move swiftly if an ideal property appears.

	

## Why Valencia?

Valencia is a master-planned portion of Santa Clarita designed with convenience and livability in mind. Residents here enjoy:

	- 
	**Well-Maintained Greenbelts and Paseos:** Pedestrian-friendly walkways that let you stroll or bike across large parts of the city without heavy traffic.

	

	- 
	**Shopping and Dining Options:** Local favorites, plus big-name retailers at Westfield Valencia Town Center, Town Center Drive, and other well-known centers.

	

	- 
	**Schools:** Part of the highly rated William S. Hart Union High School District, as well as top-notch elementary schools for younger children.

	

	- 
	**Proximity to Freeways:** Easy access to Interstate 5, making commutes to L.A.’s job centers somewhat more manageable (though traffic can still be a factor).

	

	- 
	**Community Events:** Food festivals, farmers markets, holiday celebrations, and more—plenty of ways to connect with neighbors and enjoy local culture.

	

## Putting It All Together

When you see a listing price of $900,000, it’s natural to ask: “How much does that translate into monthly payments?” The short answer is: it depends on your financing approach, your exact interest rate, and your personal financial scenario. As an example for a **conventional 20% down** buyer, principal and interest might hover around **$4,670** per month (assuming 6.75% on a $720,000 loan). After tacking on approximate HOA dues ($100), property taxes (roughly $800–$1,000/month, but can vary), and home insurance, your total often enters the $5,600–$5,800+ range.

For an **FHA 3.5% down** buyer (higher loan amount, plus monthly mortgage insurance), the principal and interest jump up to around **$5,633**—and, with MIP, property taxes, and HOA, the monthly total can exceed $6,200 or more. Meanwhile, a **VA loan** at 0% down sees a principal and interest of about **$5,837**, plus additional fees or property taxes. Each scenario is unique; these examples are purely educational.

If you’re looking at **55+ active adult communities**, your base price may be lower or higher depending on the specific floorplan, but your HOA fees might be significantly higher than a standard Valencia neighborhood because of the resort-level amenities. It can be worth it for many homeowners who plan to use the pools, pickleball courts, fitness facilities, and social clubs these communities provide.

The best approach is always to:

	- 
	**Partner with a Local Agent** who knows the nuances of Santa Clarita and can guide you to your perfect neighborhood.

	

	- 
	**Speak to a Lender** or Mortgage Broker who can walk you through available loan products, interest rates, and down payment options.

	

	- 
	**Compare Properties** carefully, factoring in each monthly cost (HOA, taxes, any special assessment, or solar lease).

	

	- 
	**Review the Community Amenities** and intangible “quality of life” features that can’t be easily captured in listing stats alone.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
