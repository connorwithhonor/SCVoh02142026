# Why Moderation Is a Trap and Forgiveness Is Your Secret Weapon for Weight Loss

The real game-changer for sustainable weight loss is forgiving yourself when you slip up and building habits that stick. As a former LAPD officer turned Santa Clarita realtor (CALDRE 01238257), I dropped 135 pounds by ditching the moderation myth, embracing fasting, and learning to move on from setbacks. This isn’t about quick fixes or trendy diets—it’s about real, no-BS strategies to transform your body and mindset. Ready to take control? Check out my journey at [https://www.youtube.com/@homemuscle](https://www.youtube.com/@homemuscle) and book a free consultation at [https://zoommescv.com](/) to discuss how discipline in fitness can translate to your real estate goals.

## The Moderation Myth: Why It’s a Setup for Failure

Let’s cut through the noise. You’ve probably heard it a million times: “Everything in moderation.” Sounds nice, right? Like a warm, fuzzy blanket of balance that’ll solve all your problems. Except, for some of us—myself included—moderation is a one-way ticket to self-sabotage. As someone who’s been through the trenches, from patrolling the streets as an LAPD motor cop to navigating the real estate market in Santa Clarita, I can tell you that moderation doesn’t work when you’re wrestling with food addiction.

Why? Because for folks like me, moderation isn’t a key—it’s a trap. Give me an inch with processed foods, and I’ll take a mile. A single taco? Forget it. I’m ordering a dozen from Jack in the Box, two large fries, and a couple of shakes to wash it all down. Sound familiar? If you’re nodding, you know that “just one bite” can spiral into a full-blown binge. That’s why I had to ditch the moderation mantra and find a strategy that actually worked.

The truth is, I lost 135 pounds in 7.5 months at age 52—going from 365 to 230 pounds—by saying no to the foods that owned me. No processed junk, no sugar highs, just real, whole foods and a whole lot of fasting. But more than that, it was about forgiving myself when I stumbled and building habits that didn’t rely on willpower alone. Let’s break it down.

## The Power of Forgiveness in Weight Loss

Here’s the deal: you’re going to mess up. We all do. Maybe you sneak a taco (or twelve) or cave to a pint of ice cream. The old me would’ve spiraled into a guilt-fest, thinking I’d blown it and might as well give up. But that’s where I went wrong for years. The game-changer? Forgiveness.

As a former cop, I know a thing or two about discipline. You don’t survive the streets without it. But discipline isn’t about being perfect—it’s about getting back up when you fall. When I started forgiving myself for slip-ups, it was like flipping a switch. Instead of beating myself up over a bad meal, I’d acknowledge it, move on, and stick to my plan. That’s the mindset that got me through those 135 pounds.

Think of it like real estate. If a deal falls through, you don’t quit the business—you analyze, adjust, and move on to the next opportunity. Same goes for your fitness journey. Forgiveness lets you keep moving forward without the baggage of guilt. Want to know more about staying focused?

## Why Fasting Worked When Moderation Didn’t

Moderation didn’t work for me because I’m an all-or-nothing guy. If I’m eating, I’m *eating*. That’s why fasting became my secret weapon. It’s not just about skipping meals—it’s about taking control and giving your body a chance to burn fat instead of fighting your cravings.

### The Science Behind Fasting

When you fast, your body taps into stored fat for energy, especially if you’re cutting out carbs that spike insulin (the storage hormone). Unlike caloric restriction, where your metabolism slows to match your reduced intake, fasting keeps your metabolic rate steady while accessing fat stores. Plus, after a day or two, your body ramps up growth hormone production, which helps preserve muscle mass—a win for staying strong and lean.

I tried the trendy intermittent fasting schedules (like 16:8, where you fast for 16 hours and eat in an 8-hour window), but they didn’t cut it. That 8-hour eating window? I’d treat it like an all-you-can-eat buffet. Instead, extended fasting—going 24, 48, or even 72 hours without food—worked better. It’s not as scary as it sounds. After the first day, hunger hormones (like ghrelin) peak and then fade, making it easier to stick with it.

**Pro Tip**: Always consult a doctor before fasting, especially if you’re on medication. Some meds need food to work properly, and fasting could mess with that. Safety first.

### Why Fasting Isn’t Starvation

Let’s clear this up: fasting isn’t about starving yourself. It’s a controlled, intentional choice to give your body a break from digestion and let it burn stored energy. You’re not locked in a prison—you can break your fast if you need to. The key is planning and discipline, just like preparing for a home purchase.

## Habits Over Hype: Building a Sustainable Routine

The fitness world is full of hype—quick fixes, magic pills, and “secret” diets. But real change comes from habits, not hacks. Here’s what worked for me:

## The Role of AI in Fitness and Real Estate

You might be wondering what fitness has to do with real estate. For me, it’s all about discipline and strategy—two things I bring to both fields. As an AI enthusiast, I’ve also explored how tools like AI can enhance decision-making, whether it’s choosing the right diet or the right home.

At [https://honorelevate.com](https://honorelevate.com), I help realtors and businesses leverage AI to streamline processes, just like I used data-driven insights to optimize my fasting routine. AI can analyze market trends, predict home values, or even suggest personalized fitness plans. Want to see how AI can transform your real estate game?

## My Journey: From LAPD to Lean and Leading in Real Estate
