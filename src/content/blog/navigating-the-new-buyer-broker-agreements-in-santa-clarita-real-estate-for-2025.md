Welcome to the Santa Clarita Open Houses blog, where we dive deep into the latest trends and legal changes affecting real estate in our vibrant community. I'm Connor with Honor, your First Responder Realtor, here to guide you through the new landscape of home buying in Santa Clarita, California.

&nbsp;

What's Changing in 2025?

Starting January 1, 2025, thanks to Assembly Bill 2992 (AB2992) passed in September by the Governor, there's a significant shift in how real estate transactions are handled in California:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

What This Means for Santa Clarita Homebuyers

Verify Your Agent's License: Before you enter into any agreement, ensure your agent is licensed with the California Department of Real Estate. Transparency begins here.

&nbsp;

Understand the Costs: The seller no longer sets the buyer's agent's compensation. You, as the buyer, will negotiate this directly with your agent. This could mean:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Impact on Sellers: Be aware that your choice of agent will directly affect the seller beyond what they initially budgeted for their listing agent's commission.

&nbsp;

Why Work With a Local Expert?

Navigating these new rules can be complex:

Final Thoughts

As we move into 2025, these changes are designed to offer more transparency and control to homebuyers. Remember, choosing an agent isn't just about finding someone to show you homes; it's about partnering with someone who will advocate for your interests, explain the intricacies of these new agreements, and help you navigate the Santa Clarita real estate market with confidence.

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
