Over two decades of law enforcement experience have taught me invaluable lessons in safety, strategy, and meticulous attention to detail. I bring these qualities into my real estate practice to ensure my clients experience not only professional expertise but also an added layer of security and preparedness in every transaction. Today, I want to share a key aspect of how I conduct business—particularly during home viewings—and why understanding exits, locking doors behind you, and ensuring full accountability during a showing is more important than ever.

### The Importance of Preparation When Viewing a Home

Much like my previous role as a first responder, preparation is key in real estate. You can't just walk into a home with only the hopes of finding your dream house; there are steps to ensure that the process is both efficient and safe.

Before entering a residence for a showing, I always give my clients a rundown. We may have an idea of what to expect based on the listing photos, descriptions, and our conversations, but all that can change once we’re physically inside. You never know what the reality will be until you're on-site. Sometimes, the home looks better than anticipated; other times, unexpected issues arise, like hidden damages, strange layouts, or even occupants that were not supposed to be there.

**Exits: Knowing Your Escape Routes** In my law enforcement days, it was imperative to assess the situation, identify potential risks, and know all available exits. It wasn’t just about getting in—it was about having an immediate exit strategy if things went sideways. The same mindset applies to real estate. When I enter a home, one of the first things I do is familiarize myself and my clients with the exits. I need to know where the back door is, just in case we have to make a quick exit.

While it may seem excessive to some, this isn’t just about safety from intruders. In rare cases, unexpected events like fire alarms or accidents can happen, and it's essential to know the quickest, safest way out. Real estate may not feel like a high-risk situation to most people, but a little preparation can prevent unnecessary stress later on.

### Securing the Home During Viewings

One of the most significant differences between how I conduct home showings and the practices of other agents comes down to securing the property. When we enter a home, I always lock the door behind us. You might wonder why I do this. It’s not just about keeping out unwelcome guests but ensuring we aren’t surprised by other agents or prospective buyers who decide to walk in unannounced.

In some real estate markets—particularly for homes that are newly listed or highly sought-after—it's not uncommon for multiple agents and their clients to tour the property simultaneously. I've been to properties where five or six different groups are wandering around at the same time. This, frankly, is a recipe for chaos. In those situations, who is accountable for what happens inside? What if something goes missing or gets damaged?

My philosophy is simple: One group at a time. If another agent arrives while I'm showing the property, they'll have to wait until we're done. This may sound strict, but it's a small action that ensures everyone’s safety, protects the seller's property, and provides my clients the quiet time they need to thoroughly evaluate the home.

### Accountability and Responsibility

During my years as a first responder, accountability was paramount. Every action we took, every decision we made, was tracked and documented. The same sense of responsibility carries over into real estate. During a showing, I consider myself fully accountable for the property and for my clients. It’s not just about walking through a house; it’s about ensuring that everything goes smoothly, safely, and according to plan.

In real estate, especially when showing homes, accountability also extends to the seller. Sellers need to be sure that their property is protected and treated with care during every visit. This is why I emphasize locking the door, ensuring one group at a time, and treating the property as if it were my own. If there’s any damage or disturbance, I want to be able to pinpoint when and how it happened—not leave it up to guesswork.

### Why This Approach Matters

In today's fast-paced real estate market, where multiple offers and intense competition are the norms, small details can make a big difference. When showing homes, I focus on creating a calm, controlled environment that allows my clients to make informed decisions. While some agents rush through showings or fail to take security precautions, I know from experience that preparation and accountability can save us from future headaches.

**For Buyers:** Buyers often get excited during showings. They're imagining their lives in the new home, thinking about furniture placements, and dreaming of backyard barbecues. My job is to make sure they also notice potential issues like structural concerns, neighborhood dynamics, and overall property safety. That’s why I provide a detailed walkthrough of each property, giving them the pros and cons based on my years of experience—not just in real estate but in assessing risks.

**For Sellers:** Sellers entrust us with their homes. Whether the home is vacant or occupied, it's important to treat the property with respect and care. As a first responder, I was trained to be vigilant, and I carry that vigilance into every property showing. This means ensuring that doors are locked, that we aren't leaving windows or gates unsecured, and that no one enters without permission.

### Real Estate Market Trends in Santa Clarita Valley

As of today, October 11, 2024, the Santa Clarita Valley real estate market is holding steady. In the last seven days, we've seen 73 new listings hit the market and 55 properties adjust their prices. Nine properties are listed as “coming soon,” showing a slight downward trend, but there’s still plenty of inventory moving in the market.

Interestingly, 24 properties have fallen out of escrow and come back on the market. This underscores the importance of proper preparation during the buying process. Whether it's due to failed inspections, financing issues, or buyer concerns, properties falling out of escrow are an indication that something went wrong. As your realtor, I work hard to prevent these hiccups by addressing potential problems upfront—whether they’re related to the home itself or the buyer’s financial qualifications.

On the selling side, the market remains competitive, with 64 properties closing in the past week. This steady pace is good news for both buyers and sellers, as it shows a balanced market with neither side having too much of an advantage.

### First Impressions Matter

When it comes to selling a home, first impressions are everything. In law enforcement, appearances could tell you a lot about a situation before even stepping inside. The same holds true for real estate.

As potential buyers approach your home, they are already forming opinions. They notice everything: the front yard, the condition of the exterior, the cleanliness of the driveway. If your neighbor's trash cans are out or their lawn is overgrown, that could detract from the appeal of your home. While these may seem like small details, they can influence a buyer’s perception before they even walk through the front door.

That’s why I work closely with sellers to ensure their home is not only show-ready on the inside but also presents well from the street. A little landscaping, a fresh coat of paint, and clean, clutter-free entryways can make a world of difference. After all, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.

### Navigating Challenges with Neighboring Properties

During a home showing, potential buyers aren’t just looking at your property—they’re evaluating the entire neighborhood. If your neighbor's tree is overhanging your yard or their fence is in disrepair, these are things that might concern a buyer. And if those concerns aren't addressed early, they could lead to complications during escrow.

For example, if a buyer is interested in your home but notices a significant overhanging tree from your neighbor's yard, that might raise questions about potential damage during storms or legal liability. If your agent is savvy (like I am), we’ll bring this up before an offer is made. That way, any potential issues can be addressed upfront, rather than derailing the sale later in the process.

Open, honest communication about these issues is essential. In some cases, the problem can be solved easily with a neighborly conversation. In other cases, legal considerations may come into play, especially if the tree is protected by local ordinances. Either way, addressing these concerns early can save both buyers and sellers from future frustrations.
