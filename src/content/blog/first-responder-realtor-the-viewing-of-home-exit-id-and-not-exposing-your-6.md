Over two decades of law enforcement experience have taught me invaluable lessons in safety, strategy, and meticulous attention to detail. I bring these qualities into my real estate practice to ensure my clients experience not only professional expertise but also an added layer of security and preparedness in every transaction. Today, I want to share a key aspect of how I conduct business—particularly during home viewings—and why understanding exits, locking doors behind you, and ensuring full accountability during a showing is more important than ever.

### The Importance of Preparation When Viewing a Home

Much like my previous role as a first responder, preparation is key in real estate. You can't just walk into a home with only the hopes of finding your dream house; there are steps to ensure that the process is both efficient and safe.

Before entering a residence for a showing, I always give my clients a rundown. We may have an idea of what to expect based on the listing photos, descriptions, and our conversations, but all that can change once we’re physically inside. You never know what the reality will be until you're on-site. Sometimes, the home looks better than anticipated; other times, unexpected issues arise, like hidden damages, strange layouts, or even occupants that were not supposed to be there.

**Exits: Knowing Your Escape Routes** In my law enforcement days, it was imperative to assess the situation, identify potential risks, and know all available exits. It wasn’t just about getting in—it was about having an immediate exit strategy if things went sideways. The same mindset applies to real estate. When I enter a home, one of the first things I do is familiarize myself and my clients with the exits. I need to know where the back door is, just in case we have to make a quick exit.

While it may seem excessive to some, this isn’t just about safety from intruders. In rare cases, unexpected events like fire alarms or accidents can happen, and it's essential to know the quickest, safest way out. Real estate may not feel like a high-risk situation to most people, but a little preparation can prevent unnecessary stress later on.

### Securing the Home During Viewings

One of the most significant differences between how I conduct home showings and the practices of other agents comes down to securing the property. When we enter a home, I always lock the door behind us. You might wonder why I do this. It’s not just about keeping out unwelcome guests but ensuring we aren’t surprised by other agents or prospective buyers who decide to walk in unannounced.

In some real estate markets—particularly for homes that are newly listed or highly sought-after—it's not uncommon for multiple agents and their clients to tour the property simultaneously. I've been to properties where five or six different groups are wandering around at the same time. This, frankly, is a recipe for chaos. In those situations, who is accountable for what happens inside? What if something goes missing or gets damaged?

My philosophy is simple: One group at a time. If another agent arrives while I'm showing the property, they'll have to wait until we're done. This may sound strict, but it's a small action that ensures everyone’s safety, protects the seller's property, and provides my clients the quiet time they need to thoroughly evaluate the home.

### Accountability and Responsibility

During my years as a first responder, accountability was paramount. Every action we took, every decision we made, was tracked and documented. The same sense of responsibility carries over into real estate. During a showing, I consider myself fully accountable for the property and for my clients. It’s not just about walking through a house; it’s about ensuring that everything goes smoothly, safely, and according to plan.

In real estate, especially when showing homes, accountability also extends to the seller. Sellers need to be sure that their property is protected and treated with care during every visit. This is why I emphasize locking the door, ensuring one group at a time, and treating the property as if it were my own. If there’s any damage or disturbance, I want to be able to pinpoint when and how it happened—not leave it up to guesswork.

### Why This Approach Matters

In today's fast-paced real estate market, where multiple offers and intense competition are the norms, small details can make a big difference. When showing homes, I focus on creating a calm, controlled environment that allows my clients to make informed decisions. While some agents rush through showings or fail to take security precautions, I know from experience that preparation and accountability can save us from future headaches.

**For Buyers:** Buyers often get excited during showings. They're imagining their lives in the new home, thinking about furniture placements, and dreaming of backyard barbecues. My job is to make sure they also notice potential issues like structural concerns, neighborhood dynamics, and overall property safety. That’s why I provide a detailed walkthrough of each property, giving them the pros and cons based on my years of experience—not just in real estate but in assessing risks.

**For Sellers:** Sellers entrust us with their homes. Whether the home is vacant or occupied, it's important to treat the property with respect and care. As a first responder, I was trained to be vigilant, and I carry that vigilance into every property showing. This means ensuring that doors are locked, that we aren't leaving windows or gates unsecured, and that no one enters without permission.

### Real Estate Market Trends in Santa Clarita Valley

As of today, October 11, 2024, the Santa Clarita Valley real estate market is holding steady. In the last seven days, we've seen 73 new listings hit the market and 55 properties adjust their prices. Nine properties are listed as “coming soon,” showing a slight downward trend, but there’s still plenty of inventory moving in the market.

Interestingly, 24 properties have fallen out of escrow and come back on the market. This underscores the importance of proper preparation during the buying process. Whether it's due to failed inspections, financing issues, or buyer concerns, properties falling out of escrow are an indication that something went wrong. As your realtor, I work hard to prevent these hiccups by addressing potential problems upfront—whether they’re related to the home itself or the buyer’s financial qualifications.

On the selling side, the market remains competitive, with 64 properties closing in the past week. This steady pace is good news for both buyers and sellers, as it shows a balanced market with neither side having too much of an advantage.

### First Impressions Matter

When it comes to selling a home, first impressions are everything. In law enforcement, appearances could tell you a lot about a situation before even stepping inside. The same holds true for real estate.

As potential buyers approach your home, they are already forming opinions. They notice everything: the front yard, the condition of the exterior, the cleanliness of the driveway. If your neighbor's trash cans are out or their lawn is overgrown, that could detract from the appeal of your home. While these may seem like small details, they can influence a buyer’s perception before they even walk through the front door.

That’s why I work closely with sellers to ensure their home is not only show-ready on the inside but also presents well from the street. A little landscaping, a fresh coat of paint, and clean, clutter-free entryways can make a world of difference. After all, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.

### Navigating Challenges with Neighboring Properties

During a home showing, potential buyers aren’t just looking at your property—they’re evaluating the entire neighborhood. If your neighbor's tree is overhanging your yard or their fence is in disrepair, these are things that might concern a buyer. And if those concerns aren't addressed early, they could lead to complications during escrow.

For example, if a buyer is interested in your home but notices a significant overhanging tree from your neighbor's yard, that might raise questions about potential damage during storms or legal liability. If your agent is savvy (like I am), we’ll bring this up before an offer is made. That way, any potential issues can be addressed upfront, rather than derailing the sale later in the process.

Open, honest communication about these issues is essential. In some cases, the problem can be solved easily with a neighborly conversation. In other cases, legal considerations may come into play, especially if the tree is protected by local ordinances. Either way, addressing these concerns early can save both buyers and sellers from future frustrations.

	- 
	**Real Estate Activity**:

	
		The Santa Clarita Valley market is showing a steady turnover with properties being sold and new listings coming in. For instance, **73 new listings** have hit the market in the last week, which is an essential sign of activity.

		- The balance between **64 closed properties** and **73 new listings** indicates that the market is keeping pace with demand, suggesting neither a buyer's nor seller's market. A balanced market like this can give both buyers and sellers reasonable negotiation power.

		- The number of **expired listings (6)** and **withdrawn listings (2)** reflects that some properties are not reaching a sale before their listing period ends, which may suggest that they were either overpriced or the conditions were not ideal for the buyers.

	

	
	- 
	**Trends in Home Pricing**:

	
		In the past week, **55 properties adjusted their prices**. This indicates sellers are actively responding to market pressures, possibly adjusting down due to reduced demand or increasing to match higher-than-expected interest.

		- Some areas are maintaining strong property values. For example, **Mountain Shadows (MTSH)** saw properties priced at **$799,900**, with prices per square foot hovering around **$338.37/sqft**​(Matrix).

	

	
	- 
	**Property Specific Insights**:

	
		The **American Beauty Condos (ABCO)** have properties listed at around **$389,999 to $454,990**, with price per square foot ranging from **$453 to $468/sqft**, showing that condo values in that area are consistent, and interest in this affordable segment is relatively high​(Matrix).

		Sellers in the current market, especially in **Santa Clarita Valley**, should focus on a few key trends that can help maximize their chances of a successful and timely sale. Here's what they should prioritize:

		### 1. **Price Adjustments Reflecting Market Conditions**

		With **55 properties adjusting their prices** in the past week alone, sellers need to be responsive to market trends. If properties are sitting too long without serious buyer interest, it's often a sign that the price may not align with market expectations. Pricing competitively from the start—based on recent sales data and neighborhood comparables—can help prevent your listing from becoming stale.

		### 2. **First Impressions Matter More Than Ever**

		With **64 properties closing** in the past week, it’s clear that homes are still moving, but sellers need to prioritize curb appeal and staging. A fresh coat of paint, minor repairs, and even front yard landscaping can go a long way in making the home stand out. Buyers are often deciding based on their first impression, which starts the moment they pull up to the property.

		### 3. **Focus on Timely and Appealing Upgrades**

		Price adjustments often reflect buyer expectations for value, so sellers should focus on upgrades that provide the best return. **Energy-efficient upgrades**, new appliances, and well-maintained HVAC systems are particularly appealing to today’s buyers, many of whom are sensitive to long-term operational costs. Installing **lifetime warranty features**—like windows and doors—could also be a major selling point as it demonstrates a commitment to quality that buyers will appreciate.

		### 4. **Monitor Inventory Shifts Closely**

		With **73 new listings** in the last week and **24 properties falling out of escrow**, sellers must remain competitive and aware of market conditions. The fact that properties are coming back onto the market is a reminder that escrow can fail, often due to inspections or financing issues. Sellers should ensure that their home is well-maintained, inspections are thorough, and any known issues are addressed beforehand to avoid complications during the closing process.

		### 5. **Leverage Active Buyer Interest**

		Despite a balanced market, **properties coming back on the market** after falling out of escrow could create opportunities for motivated sellers. If there is a unique feature to your home, such as prime location, updated amenities, or a desirable school district, now is the time to leverage those assets in your marketing strategy. Highlight those benefits in listing descriptions and showings to differentiate your home from others that may be priced similarly.

		### 6. **Staying Aware of Competition**

		The number of **new listings and price changes** signals an active market. Sellers should monitor nearby competition closely, keeping an eye on how many similar homes are available and adjusting pricing and marketing strategies accordingly. With **39 active under contract** and **44 pending sales**, this data suggests there is healthy buyer interest, but competition among sellers is growing.

		### 7. **Prioritize Safety and Security for Showings**

		While it's important to prepare your home for showings, it’s also crucial to make buyers feel safe. In a post-COVID environment, buyers want reassurance that a home is secure and well-maintained. Highlighting security features, such as smart locks, security cameras, or neighborhood safety, can enhance the perceived value of the property.

		### 8. **Flexibility in Negotiations**

		Given the number of **price changes** and **back-on-market properties**, flexibility is key. Whether negotiating closing costs or making small repairs after an inspection, sellers who are willing to negotiate can maintain buyer interest and avoid unnecessary delays in closing.

		
		By keeping a close eye on these trends, sellers in Santa Clarita can stay ahead of the curve, making strategic decisions that align with current market conditions. Each of these priorities can help maximize the chances of a successful sale, especially in a competitive environment.

		In the current **Santa Clarita Valley** real estate market, buyers need to be aware of several key trends that could impact their purchasing decisions and strategies. Here’s what they should prioritize:

		### 1. **Act Quickly in a Competitive Market**

		With **73 new listings** and **64 properties closing** in the past week, it’s clear that homes are moving quickly. This means buyers should be prepared to act fast when they find a home they love. Having financing pre-approved and ready will help avoid delays. In a competitive market, properties can receive multiple offers quickly, so being able to make an offer without hesitation can make the difference.

		### 2. **Leverage Price Adjustments to Your Advantage**

		The fact that **55 properties have adjusted their prices** indicates that some sellers are willing to lower prices to attract buyers. If you’ve been eyeing a property that hasn’t sold for a while, now might be a good time to make a competitive offer. Price adjustments suggest that sellers are responding to market conditions and may be more willing to negotiate.

		### 3. **Be Wary of Back-on-Market Properties**

		With **24 properties falling out of escrow** and coming back onto the market, buyers should approach these homes carefully. Properties that return to the market could indicate issues, such as failed inspections, appraisal problems, or financing falling through. When considering these homes, it’s essential to thoroughly inspect the property and review the reason why the deal fell apart previously. However, these homes could also present an opportunity to negotiate a better price if the seller is eager to close quickly.

		### 4. **Understand Financing and Rate Impacts**

		The fluctuating mortgage rates, still hovering over 6%, continue to affect buyer affordability. It's important for buyers to keep an eye on interest rates as they impact your long-term financial commitment. Securing a loan at a slightly lower rate—even just half a percent—can save tens of thousands over the life of a mortgage. Buyers may want to explore options like **locking in rates** early to protect themselves from rate increases while still looking for the right home.

		### 5. **Target Homes with Long-Term Value**

		With **price adjustments** becoming common, buyers have the opportunity to focus on homes with strong resale potential. Features like **energy-efficient appliances**, **updated HVAC systems**, and **windows with transferable lifetime warranties** add long-term value to a home. These features not only make homes more attractive to buyers now but will also help when it comes time to sell. As a buyer, keep an eye out for homes that offer these types of investments.

		### 6. **Leverage Contingencies and Due Diligence**

		Although the market remains competitive, buyers should not waive contingencies lightly. The fact that many properties are **back on the market** suggests that something went wrong during inspections or financing stages. Conduct thorough due diligence, get professional inspections, and ensure your contingencies (like financing, inspections, or appraisals) are solid. This helps prevent you from running into unexpected repairs or financial issues down the road.

		### 7. **Consider Areas with Lower Competition**

		Some properties might be sitting longer than expected, which could mean there’s less competition in certain areas or for certain home types. Neighborhoods with fewer listings or homes that haven't seen as much activity might offer better deals. Pay attention to areas that may not be as hot right now but still offer good value and long-term growth potential.

		### 8. **Explore Inventory Beyond Just New Listings**

		With a number of homes becoming **active under contract** and others **pending sale**, buyers should explore more than just the new listings. Sometimes older listings are still available and have reduced competition. Additionally, checking homes that have fallen out of escrow might present you with hidden opportunities to get a property at a more favorable price.

		### 9. **Negotiate Closing Costs and Repairs**

		Given the trend of **price adjustments** and **back-on-market listings**, buyers may have more room to negotiate than they think. In addition to discussing price, buyers should also consider negotiating closing costs or requesting repairs based on inspection results. Sellers who are motivated to close may be more willing to offer concessions, particularly if their home has already been sitting for a while.

		### 10. **Prepare for Multiple Offer Situations**

		With **multiple offers still common** on well-priced homes, buyers need to have a strategy in place for dealing with competition. Consider offering an earnest money deposit, limiting contingencies where you're comfortable, or even writing a personal letter to the seller. In a fast-moving market, being strategic with your offer can make the difference between securing your dream home or missing out.

		
		### Final Thoughts for Buyers:

		The **Santa Clarita Valley** real estate market is moving fast, and buyers need to be prepared, strategic, and flexible. By paying attention to **price adjustments**, **properties coming back on the market**, and **market competition**, buyers can make informed decisions and secure homes that provide both immediate satisfaction and long-term value. Understanding current financing conditions and how they impact affordability is crucial, and being ready to negotiate on price, repairs, and closing costs can give buyers an edge in a competitive market.

		If you're a buyer in today's market, it's essential to stay proactive and be ready to seize opportunities as they arise.

		Buyers in today’s real estate market, especially in areas like **Santa Clarita Valley**, are more discerning than ever, and their preferences reflect both lifestyle priorities and practical considerations. Below are some of the most sought-after home features that buyers prioritize:

		### 1. **Energy Efficiency**

		Buyers are increasingly prioritizing homes with **energy-efficient features** due to rising utility costs and environmental concerns. Features such as:

		

		- **Energy-efficient windows and doors**

		- **High-efficiency HVAC systems**

		- **Solar panels** or pre-wired setups for solar

		- **Energy Star-rated appliances** These additions not only reduce utility bills but also make the home more sustainable, which is an important consideration for many buyers.

		- 
		### 2. **Updated Kitchens and Bathrooms**

		Kitchens and bathrooms are some of the most critical spaces in a home, and buyers want these areas to be both functional and visually appealing. Preferred features include:

		

		- **Granite or quartz countertops**

		- **Stainless steel appliances**

		- **Modern cabinetry and fixtures**

		- **Double sinks in bathrooms**

		- **Walk-in showers** or **soaking tubs** Kitchens, in particular, are seen as the heart of the home, and a well-designed kitchen can be a significant selling point.

		- 
		### 3. **Open Floor Plans**

		Open-concept layouts remain a top priority for many buyers, as they prefer homes where the **kitchen, living room, and dining areas flow together**. Open floor plans are perfect for:

		

		- Entertaining guests

		- Keeping an eye on children while cooking

		- Allowing natural light to spread throughout the home Many buyers also like the flexibility that open spaces offer in terms of furniture arrangement and decor.

		- 
		### 4. **Home Office Space**

		With the rise of remote work and flexible working conditions, **dedicated office spaces** have become increasingly desirable. Even a well-lit nook or converted guest room that can serve as a **home office** adds value to a property. Key features include:

		

		- **Built-in shelving**

		- **Soundproofing**

		- **Strong internet connections** or wired setups for enhanced connectivity Homes that provide quiet, private spaces for working or studying have become highly coveted.

		- 
		### 5. **Smart Home Technology**

		-

		- **Outdoor kitchens** or built-in grills

		- **Fire pits** for entertaining

		- **Landscaped gardens** with low-maintenance plants

		- 
		### 7. **Storage Space**

		- **Walk-in closets**

		- 
		### 8. **Turnkey Homes**

		Many buyers, especially first-time homebuyers or busy professionals, are looking for **turnkey homes**—properties that require little to no immediate work after purchase. These homes should be move-in ready, with:

		

		- Fresh paint

		- Updated flooring

		- Recent appliance upgrades

		- Well-maintained roofs and HVAC systems Turnkey homes allow buyers to avoid the hassle and additional cost of renovations and move into a space that’s already polished and modern.

		- 
		### 9. **Flexible Living Spaces**

		As family dynamics shift, buyers are also looking for **multi-functional spaces** that can serve different purposes. For example:

		

		- **Bonus rooms** that can be used as game rooms, media rooms, or playrooms

		- **Basement conversions** that offer extra living space

		- **In-law suites** or guest rooms with separate entrances for extended family or visitors These adaptable spaces provide buyers with the opportunity to customize the home to fit their unique needs.

		- 
		### 11. **Quality Flooring**

		- **Hardwood flooring**

		- **Luxury vinyl planks (LVP)**

		- **Tile flooring** in bathrooms and kitchens Carpeting is still popular in bedrooms, but buyers tend to prefer hardwood or laminate for the rest of the home because of its longevity and appeal.

		- 
		### 12. **Neighborhood Amenities**

		It’s not just about the home itself—buyers often prioritize **neighborhood amenities** when choosing where to live. Homes located near:

		

		- **Parks and green spaces**

		- **Shopping centers**

		- **Good schools**

		- **Public transportation**

		- **Restaurants and entertainment venues** These factors make the home more desirable and can enhance resale value. Neighborhoods with active community centers or organized neighborhood watch programs are also appealing.

		- 
		
		### Final Thoughts for Buyers:

		Today's home buyers are looking for a mix of modern conveniences, sustainability, and flexibility. Homes that offer **energy efficiency**, **smart technology**, **outdoor living spaces**, and **turnkey readiness** are particularly desirable in the current market. Sellers who can highlight these features and position their homes accordingly will have a competitive advantage.

		

		- **Pantry space**

		- **Built-in storage units**

		- **Attics or basements with usable space** These features offer the flexibility and practicality buyers are looking for. Even bonus spaces like **mudrooms** or **utility rooms** add appeal for families that need more functional space.
