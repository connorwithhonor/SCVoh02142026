One critical factor is **property tax reassessment**, a process that can change the amount of property taxes owed on a home. Whether you’re selling your home in Valencia or buying a condo in Canyon Country, understanding reassessment ensures you make informed decisions without unexpected costs.

I’m Connor MacIvor, a former LAPD motor cop turned realtor (CALDRE 01238257), and I’ve helped countless clients navigate the complexities of Santa Clarita real estate. With my background in high-stakes decision-making and my commitment to honesty, I’m here to break down property tax reassessment in a way that’s clear, actionable, and maybe even a little entertaining. Let’s dive into what reassessment means, how it works, and how it impacts you as a buyer or seller in Santa Clarita.

## What Is Property Tax Reassessment?

Property tax reassessment occurs when a county assessor re-evaluates the value of a property to determine its new tax base. In California, property taxes are governed by **Proposition 13**, passed in 1978, which limits annual property tax increases to no more than 2% unless specific events trigger a reassessment. When a property is reassessed, its taxable value is updated to reflect its current market value, which can significantly increase or decrease the tax bill.

In Santa Clarita, reassessments are handled by the Los Angeles County Assessor’s Office. The process is critical because it directly affects how much you’ll pay in property taxes as a homeowner or what buyers will face after purchasing your home.

## Proposition 13: The Foundation of California Property Taxes

To understand reassessment, you need to know the basics of Proposition 13. This landmark legislation caps property taxes at **1% of the property’s assessed value** at the time of purchase, plus a maximum 2% annual increase for inflation. This means if you bought a home in Santa Clarita for $500,000 in 2010, your initial tax bill would be around $5,000 per year, increasing by up to 2% annually, even if the home’s market value skyrockets.

However, certain events can trigger a reassessment, resetting the tax base to the current market value. For example, if that same home is now worth $900,000 and is sold, the new owner’s tax bill could jump to $9,000 annually (plus the 2% annual increase). Understanding these triggers is crucial for both buyers and sellers.

## When Does Property Tax Reassessment Happen?

Reassessment isn’t an everyday occurrence. In Santa Clarita, the Los Angeles County Assessor’s Office reassesses properties under specific circumstances. Here are the primary triggers:

### 1. Change of Ownership

When a property changes hands, such as during a sale, it’s typically reassessed at its current market value. For example:

### 2. New Construction or Major Improvements

Adding a new room, a pool, or other significant improvements can trigger a partial reassessment. For instance:

### 3. Transfer Between Family Members

Certain family transfers, like gifting a home to a child, may qualify for exemptions under **Proposition 58** or **Proposition 193**, which allow the property to retain its original tax base. This is a huge benefit for Santa Clarita families passing down homes in areas like Newhall or Castaic.

### 4. Disaster or Damage

If a property is damaged due to a natural disaster (e.g., wildfire or earthquake), the assessor may temporarily reduce the tax base until repairs are made. This is rare but worth noting for Santa Clarita properties in fire-prone areas like Acton (see listings at https://www./blog/homes-for-sale-in-acton-ca).

## Exemptions and Protections: Saving on Taxes

California offers several exemptions to soften the blow of reassessment. Here’s what Santa Clarita homeowners and buyers should know:

### Proposition 60/90: Senior Citizen Transfers

If you’re over 55 and selling your home in Santa Clarita to buy another within Los Angeles County (or certain other counties), you may transfer your existing tax base to the new property under **Proposition 60/90**. This can save thousands in taxes. For example:

### Homeowner’s Exemption

Homeowners who live in their Santa Clarita property as their primary residence can claim a **$7,000 exemption** on the assessed value, reducing their tax bill slightly.

### Parent-Child and Grandparent-Grandchild Transfers

As mentioned, **Proposition 58** and **Proposition 193** allow certain family transfers to avoid reassessment. This is ideal for legacy planning in neighborhoods like Granada Hills (https://www./blog/homes-for-sale-in-granada-hills-ca).
