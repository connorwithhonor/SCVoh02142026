# Santa Clarita Market 2025: Why May Was Chaos &amp; December Is Your Goldmine

**By Connor MacIvor (Connor with Honor)** *Retired LAPD (20+ Years), Realtor since 1998, Business A.I. Growth Architect*

If there is one thing I learned in over two decades of law enforcement and nearly 30 years in real estate, it is that data does not lie—but people often do. When you are looking to buy or sell a home in the Santa Clarita Valley, you are bombarded with noise. Zillow estimates, Redfin "hot takes," and agents who bought their way to the top of a search result page.

That is not how we operate here.

I am Connor MacIvor. I served the city of Los Angeles for 17 years as a regular officer and another 5 as a reserve. I am honorably retired—retired with the status, but I don't take the pension. I work for a living. I am a full-time Realtor, known as the **@FirstResponderRealtor**, and I have built **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com** to be the only organic, locally sourced real estate agent referral system in the valley. When I refer an agent to you, it is because I have vetted them personally, not because they paid a subscription fee to be there.

Today, we are diving deep into the 2025 numbers. We are looking at the Median Days on Market (DOM) and the Active Listing counts for our key cities: Castaic, Canyon Country, Newhall, Saugus, Stevenson Ranch, and Valencia. If you want to make a move in 2026, you need to understand what just happened in 2025.

## The 2025 Market Snapshot: Speed vs. Inventory

Let’s look at the raw data for Single Family Residences across the valley. The trend line for 2025 tells a story of frantic energy in the spring and a strategic tightening in the winter.

### The Speed of the Market (Median Days to Sell)

### The Inventory Rollercoaster (Number of Active Listings)

What does this tell us? It tells us that if you were a buyer in **May**, you were in a shark tank. Homes were flying off the market in 18 days. But if you waited until **June**, you had the most choices with 853 active listings. Conversely, if you are looking right now, or planning for late 2026, realize that December inventory drops hard—down to 546 listings. Less competition for sellers, but fewer choices for buyers.

## City-by-City Breakdown: Where Should You Look?

The Santa Clarita Valley is not a monolith. Each area has its own flavor, its own price points, and its own market velocity. Here is how the 2025 trends impact the specific communities I serve.

### **Valencia: The Heart of the Valley**

Valencia often drives the stats for the entire region. With its master-planned communities and the famous Paseo system, demand here is relentless. In May, when the median DOM hit 18 days, Valencia was likely moving even faster—closer to 10 or 12 days for turnkey properties. If you are looking for **[homes for sale in Valencia CA](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-valencia-ca)**, you need an agent who understands how to write a winning offer in a multiple-bid situation. I can connect you with specialists who know the difference between Northbridge and Northpark blindfolded.

### **Stevenson Ranch: The Westside Gem**

Just west of the I-5, **[homes for sale in Stevenson Ranch CA](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-stevenson-ranch-ca)** offer proximity to Los Angeles for commuters. The inventory here tends to be tighter than in Canyon Country. When we see the valley-wide inventory drop to 546 in December, Stevenson Ranch often represents a very small slice of that pie. If you want into the award-winning school districts here, you cannot afford to wait for "the perfect time." The perfect time is when a listing actually hits the market.

### **Saugus: Family Friendly and Fierce**

Saugus is famous for its parks and schools. During the June inventory peak of 853 listings, a good chunk of those were **[homes for sale in Saugus CA](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-saugus-ca)**. This area has seen a resurgence in popularity due to newer developments and the charm of the older, larger lots. If you are watching my YouTube channel **@SantaClaritaOpenHouses**, you know we highlight the best open houses here regularly.

### **Canyon Country: More House for Your Money**

If you are looking for value, or perhaps a larger lot for horses or toys, **[homes for sale in Canyon Country CA](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-canyon-country-ca)** are where you start. The DOM in Canyon Country can sometimes be slightly higher than Valencia, giving buyers a little more breathing room to negotiate, especially in months like October where the valley-wide average hit 41 days.

### **Newhall: Historic Charm**

Newhall is seeing a renaissance with the revitalization of Main Street. **[Homes for sale in Newhall CA](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-newhall-ca)** range from historic bungalows to massive custom estates in Happy Valley. It is a diverse market that requires a diverse skillset to navigate.

### **Castaic: The Gateway North**

For those who want more land or newer construction at a better price point, **[homes for sale in Castaic CA](https://www.santaclaritaopenhouses.com/homes-for-sale-in-castaic-ca)** are the answer. With the data showing inventory tightening in winter, Castaic often remains a viable option for buyers who get priced out of Valencia.

## The "Organic" Difference: Vetting Agents Like I Vetted Suspects

You see the term "Organic Agent Referral" on my site. What does that mean? In the real estate world, there are massive referral networks. You know the names. They charge agents a huge fee to receive your information as a "lead." The agent doesn't get that lead because they are the best; they get it because they paid the most.

I don't play that game.

My referral system is built on **trust and verification**. I spent 20+ years in the LAPD. I know how to investigate. I know how to read people. When you come to **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com** and ask for an agent, I am not sending you to the highest bidder. I am hunting down the agent who fits *your* specific needs.

I interview them. I check their track record. I ensure they are not just "salespeople" but true fiduciaries. This is the same discipline I apply to my own life, whether it is dropping 135 pounds of fat through intermittent fasting (check out **@FastingwithHonor** and **@Homemuscle**) or mastering the Artificial Intelligence space.

## Integrating AI into Your Real Estate Journey

Speaking of AI, we are not just using it to write listing descriptions. We are using it to analyze growth and opportunities. As a Business A.I. Growth Architect, I am implementing these strategies to help agents serve you better. If you are an agent reading this, or a business owner in Santa Clarita, you need to be looking at how AI can streamline your operations. I have moved away from the old affiliate models. If you want to see what I am building, check out **[http://santaclaritaartificialintelligence.com/webinar](http://santaclaritaartificialintelligence.com/webinar)**. It is about using technology to enhance the human connection, not replace it.

For my fellow agents who want to elevate their game, visit **[https://honorelevate.com](https://honorelevate.com)**. We are building a community of professionals who use tools like GoHighLevel (my affiliate link is **[https://www.gohighlevel.com/?fp_ref=connorwithhonor](https://www.gohighlevel.com/?fp_ref=connorwithhonor)**) to ensure no client falls through the cracks.

## Strategic Advice for Buyers in 2026

Based on the 2025 data, here is your game plan:

## Strategic Advice for Sellers in 2026

## Q &amp; A: Santa Clarita Real Estate

**Q: Why do you emphasize that you are a "First Responder Realtor"?** **A:** Because in law enforcement, integrity is everything. When I put on the badge, I swore to protect and serve. I carry that same ethos into real estate. I am not here to make a quick commission; I am here to protect your equity. You can see more of my perspective on my YouTube channel **@FirstResponderRealtor**.

**Q: Is the market crashing?** **A:** Look at the data. We saw days on market fluctuate, but we did not see a collapse. Inventory fluctuates seasonally. A crash is usually precipitous and sustained. What we are seeing in 2025 is a return to seasonality.

**Q: How do I get started with your referral system?** **A:** It is simple. Go to **SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com**, or reach out to me directly. Tell me what you are looking for. I will do the legwork. I will vet the agents. I will present you with the best options.

**Q: What is the "Ticket Whisperer"?** **A:** That is another hat I wear! Check out **@TicketWhisperer** on YouTube. It’s all about navigating the complexities of traffic/legal issues, which again, ties back to my LAPD background—knowing the system and how to navigate it for your benefit.

## Summary

2025 was a year of defined seasons in Santa Clarita real estate. We saw the frantic pace of May (18 days to sell) and the heavy inventory of June (853 listings). We saw the market catch its breath in October (41 days to sell) and hibernate in December (546 active listings).

Understanding these cycles is the difference between overpaying and getting a deal. It is the difference between your home sitting on the market for months or selling in weeks.

You need an interpreter for this data. You need a guide who isn't influenced by a corporate algorithm or a "pay-to-play" lead generation model. You need someone who has vetted the players and knows the game.

I am Connor MacIvor. I am Connor with Honor. Whether you are buying your first condo in Canyon Country, upgrading to an estate in Valencia, or looking to integrate AI into your local business, I am here to help.

Let’s get to work.

### **Conversational Dialogue: The "Why" Behind the Vetting**

*I was speaking with a client the other day, let's call him Mike. Mike is a retired firefighter.*

**Mike:** "Connor, why can't I just click the button on Zillow? An agent pops up, I meet them, we buy the house."

**Connor:** "Mike, you can. But do you know *why* that agent popped up?"

**Mike:** "Because they sell the most homes in that zip code?"

**Connor:** "No. It's because they paid Zillow a few thousand dollars a month for that zip code. They might be a rookie. They might be a shark who will push you into a money pit just to close the deal. When you were on the force, did you trust every rookie with the hose on the first day?"

**Mike:** "Hell no."

**Connor:** "Exactly. I vet these agents like I'm doing a background check. I check their sales ratios, their negotiation history, and their reputation with other agents. If they don't pass my smell test, you never hear their name."

**Mike:** "So you're the firewall."

**Connor:** "I'm the firewall. And the safety net."

**Disclaimer:** *I am a referral agent and Realtor. I seek a referral fee from the agents I place you with. This ensures I stay involved and accountable to you throughout the process. I do not charge you, the buyer or seller, for this service. My loyalty is to the truth and to your success.*

## Full Transparency

Yes, I earn referral fees when you work with agents I recommend. But unlike national platforms like Zillow or Realtor.com, I personally know and vet every single agent in my network of 17 trusted professionals.

My recommendations are based on YOUR specific needs and the complexity of your situation—not who pays the highest referral fee. I live in Santa Clarita Valley, and my reputation in this community depends on your success. Local accountability matters.
