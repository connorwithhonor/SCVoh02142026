### Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Update – July 28, 2024

![](https://idx-acnt-ihouseprd.b-cdn.net/AR1197716/file_manager/Muscle%20in%20Santa%20Clarita%20Valley%20and%20open%20houses%20for%20sale%20today.png?width=450&amp;height=253&amp;aspect_ratio=450%3A253)Good day, everyone! This is Connor MacIVOR with your Santa Clarita real estate update for Sunday, July 28, 2024. Here’s what’s been happening in our local market over the past week.

#### Market Watch Overview

In the last seven days, we’ve seen some notable activity in the Santa Clarita real estate market:

	- **Coming Soon Listings:** 6

	- **New Listings:** 82

	- **Price Changes:** 77 (predominantly price reductions, accounting for 90% of changes)

	- **Back on Market:** 22

	- **Active Under Contract:** 34

	- **Pending Sales:** 53

	- **Closed Sales:** 53

	- **Expired Listings:** 2

	- **Cancelled Listings:** 11

	- **Withdrawn Listings:** 3

This brings the total active inventory across all Santa Clarita Valley cities to 476 listings.

#### Current Market Insights

While driving through various communities, I observed several homes with real estate signs posted. It’s crucial for sellers to maintain excellent curb appeal when advertising their property. You never know when a potential buyer might drive by, and first impressions matter. On the flip side, if you choose not to display a sign, ensure your property is prominently featured in online search systems, as that is how most buyers find listings today.

#### The Importance of Real Estate Signs and Open Houses

Even though online listings are the primary method for finding properties, having a physical real estate sign can still attract local buyers who might otherwise miss your property. Hosting open houses, which we feature on SantaClaritaOpenHouses.com, can further extend the reach of your listing, bringing in more potential buyers and increasing competition.

#### Interest Rates and Buyer Activity

Recent media reports suggest that interest rates may decrease by September 2024 due to reversing inflation trends. If you’re a buyer, now is the time to get pre-approved and pre-qualified for a mortgage. Waiting until September might put you at a disadvantage due to increased competition. Historically, interest rate reductions lead to higher demand and multiple offers on properties, making the buying process more competitive.

#### Strategic Market Timing

Sellers contemplating listing their homes in September should weigh the pros and cons. If interest rates drop, buyer competition will increase, potentially driving up offers. However, this can also lead to some buyers experiencing regret, feeling they overpaid, and seeking price reductions through repair requests or other means. It’s a delicate balance, and careful consideration is essential.

#### Conclusion

Both buyers and sellers face exciting opportunities and challenges in the current market. As your trusted real estate advisor, I’m here to guide you through every step, ensuring you make informed decisions that align with your goals.
