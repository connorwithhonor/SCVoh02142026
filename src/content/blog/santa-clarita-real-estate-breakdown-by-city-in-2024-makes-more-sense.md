Welcome to the **Santa Clarita Valley Real Estate Market Update** for Friday, November 8, 2024. I’m Connor MacIvor, known as "Connor with Honor," your First Responder Realtor, here to provide a detailed, city-specific look at the latest in Santa Clarita real estate. As we approach the end of the year, let’s dive into the current market landscape and understand how Santa Clarita’s neighborhoods are performing.

### Total Active Listings Across Santa Clarita Valley

We currently have **530 active listings** across Santa Clarita Valley, a dynamic mix of single-family residences, attached and detached condominiums, and townhomes. Each city brings unique inventory and market trends, with an ongoing demand that shapes our local housing market.

Here’s a breakdown of active listings in each major Santa Clarita Valley city:

Each city caters to various buyer preferences, whether you’re looking for a spacious single-family home or a more compact condo or townhome.

### Single-Family Homes, Condos, and Townhomes by City

### Recent Market Activity and Price Adjustments

In the past seven days, we’ve observed notable shifts in the Santa Clarita market:

### Market Insights and Considerations for Buyers and Sellers

#### 1. **Staying Within Budget**

With median prices in Santa Clarita Valley often exceeding the national average, buyers may feel the pressure to stretch their budgets. Experts like Kevin O’Leary recommend keeping monthly housing costs within 30% of after-tax income, which can be challenging in our local market. By carefully selecting properties or exploring condos and townhomes, first-time buyers can enter the market while maintaining financial flexibility.

#### 2. **Price Reductions and Market Readjustments**

Price adjustments signal a more balanced market, offering opportunities for buyers who might have felt priced out earlier this year. Sellers are increasingly willing to negotiate, which can be advantageous for buyers actively searching in Santa Clarita.

#### 3. **Interest Rates and Timing Your Purchase**

Interest rates remain a key factor. With fluctuations around 6-7%, locking in a favorable rate can save thousands over the life of a loan. November's upcoming Federal Reserve meeting may influence rates further, so stay in close contact with your lender about re-locking options if rates drop.

#### 4. **Neighborhood-Specific Insights**

Understanding the unique trends of each city within Santa Clarita Valley is crucial. For instance, Valencia and Stevenson Ranch remain popular for their community amenities and proximity to quality schools, while Saugus and Canyon Country provide more affordable single-family home options. Selecting the right area can impact your quality of life, budget, and investment potential.

### Local Market Trends by City

#### **Castaic**:

With 50 active listings, Castaic remains a quieter, suburban option. It’s ideal for those looking for a more rural feel with larger single-family homes and a selection of condos. With its close proximity to recreational areas like Castaic Lake, this city offers a balance between nature and suburban life.

#### **Canyon Country**:

Canyon Country’s 120 active listings include a mix of single-family homes and condos, catering to a diverse buyer base. It’s one of the more affordable areas within Santa Clarita Valley, appealing to first-time buyers and families looking for room to grow.

#### **Newhall**:

With 60 listings, Newhall offers historic charm, a mix of older and newer homes, and close proximity to the Metro for commuters. It’s a great option for those wanting a central location with rich cultural offerings, from historic districts to theaters.

#### **Saugus**:

Saugus, with 100 listings, provides a solid mix of family-oriented neighborhoods and newer developments. It’s known for excellent schools and parks, appealing to families who want a close-knit community.

#### **Stevenson Ranch**:

A prestigious area with 40 active listings, Stevenson Ranch is known for upscale homes and picturesque landscapes. It’s a top choice for buyers seeking luxury, larger homes, and proximity to top-rated schools.

#### **Valencia**:

Valencia leads with 160 listings and is widely popular for its planned communities, paseo systems, and shopping centers. This city offers something for everyone, from condos to spacious single-family residences.

### The Importance of Local Knowledge

When choosing an agent, consider the value of working with someone who knows the Santa Clarita Valley inside and out. An agent familiar with the intricacies of each city can guide you through neighborhood-specific trends, school zones, and even specific HOA regulations, which can vary widely across the valley.
