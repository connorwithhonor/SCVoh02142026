# Santa Clarita Real Estate Market: Active Listings, Market Insights, and Expert Tips from Your First Responder Realtor

If you're looking to buy or sell a home in Santa Clarita, you're in the right place. As your First Responder Realtor, I take pride in keeping you informed about the latest real estate trends and opportunities in this dynamic market. Whether you’re hunting for a dream home or thinking of selling your current property, it's crucial to stay updated on the ever-changing landscape of Santa Clarita real estate.

### A Snapshot of the Santa Clarita Real Estate Market as of October 25, 2024

As of October 25th, 2024 – the 299th day of the year – the Santa Clarita real estate market is bustling with activity. Let’s get straight to the numbers:

	- **555 active residential listings** – This includes condos, townhomes, and single-family homes, both attached and detached.

	- **9 coming soon listings** – These properties will be available to the market soon, so if you’re serious about buying, get connected with me to be the first in line.

	- **60 new listings** – Fresh inventory has hit the market in the last seven days, providing a wealth of options for buyers.

	- **97 price adjustments** – This signals a shift in seller expectations, giving buyers a chance to find homes that better fit their budgets.

	- **19 back on market listings** – These homes were under contract but are now available again, offering a second chance for buyers.

	- **31 properties active under contract** – These homes are under contract but open for backup offers, giving buyers another strategy for competitive markets.

	- **41 pending homes** – These homes are on their way to closing, showing healthy market demand.

	- **47 closed sales** – Strong demand continues to drive successful transactions.

	- **6 expired listings** – These homes did not sell within the contract period, which might present an opportunity for savvy buyers.

	- **15 canceled listings** – Sellers have decided to pull these homes off the market for now, but they could return later.

	- **9 listings on hold** – These properties are temporarily off the market but will likely return soon.

	- **0 withdrawn listings** – No homes have been fully withdrawn, which is a good sign of seller confidence.

### What Do These Numbers Mean for Santa Clarita Home Buyers?

If you're in the market for a new home, Santa Clarita offers a variety of opportunities. With **60 new listings** this week alone, you’ll find plenty of fresh options to explore. Whether you're searching for a cozy condo or a spacious family home, the inventory remains diverse, and there’s something for every type of buyer.

### What Do the Price Adjustments Indicate?

With **97 price changes** in the past week, it's clear that sellers are adjusting their expectations to align with the current market. This can be a major opportunity for buyers to negotiate better deals, especially if you've been watching a property that was initially priced out of your budget. A price adjustment could bring that dream home into your range.

### Coming Soon Listings: Get Ahead of the Curve

One of the best ways to secure a great deal in Santa Clarita is to act fast. With **9 coming soon listings**, buyers who stay connected with a knowledgeable realtor can gain early access to properties before they officially hit the market. These pre-market opportunities often give you a competitive edge, allowing you to see homes before the general public.

If you want access to these listings, reach out to me directly. I can help you navigate the coming soon properties and ensure you’re one of the first to tour them.

### Why Do Listings Fall Out of Contract?

We’ve seen **19 properties come back on the market** this week after initially going under contract. This could happen for a variety of reasons – financing falls through, inspection issues arise, or buyers get cold feet. For you, as a potential buyer, this means a second chance to secure a property that may have slipped through your fingers before. It's also an indicator that backup offers, which I highly recommend, are a strong strategy in a market like ours.

### Active Under Contract: What It Means for Buyers

When you see a property listed as **active under contract** – and we currently have **31 properties in this status** – it means an offer has been accepted, but the seller is still open to backup offers. If you’ve been eyeing a property that’s under contract, don’t give up. Submitting a backup offer could land you the home if the current deal falls through. It’s a smart move in a competitive market, and I’ve seen it work for many of my clients.

### What Do Pending Sales Tell Us?

**41 pending sales** are homes in the final stages before closing, meaning the market is moving. Pending sales give us a glimpse of what’s about to close, showing that buyers are making decisions and sellers are closing deals. If you’re in the market, this level of activity should give you confidence that the market is healthy and active. But don’t wait too long – competition is still strong, and well-priced homes are moving fast.

### For Home Sellers: Understanding Expired and Canceled Listings

If you're a seller and your home isn't moving, it’s crucial to understand why. This week, **6 listings expired** because they didn’t sell within the contract period. Expired listings often signal that the property was priced too high or didn’t receive the right marketing push. If you’re in this position, don’t get discouraged. A strategic price adjustment or a refreshed marketing strategy can help you get back on track.

Additionally, **15 sellers canceled their listings**, deciding now wasn’t the right time to sell. Canceled listings might come back later, often with new pricing or after sellers make improvements to the property. This is where timing and market conditions play a huge role. As your Realtor, I can help you evaluate when the right time to list your home is, so you avoid becoming an expired or canceled listing.

### Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Insights: The Big Picture

Santa Clarita is moving, and as your First Responder Realtor, I’m here to make sure you’re informed at every step. With a total of **555 active listings**, this market is ripe with opportunity for both buyers and sellers. But the key to success is staying sharp and knowing how to navigate these numbers.

### Tips for Santa Clarita Home Buyers in This Market

	- 
	**Get Pre-Approved**

	Before you start shopping, get pre-approved for a mortgage. This not only helps you understand your budget but also positions you as a serious buyer when you make offers. In a competitive market like Santa Clarita, where homes are going under contract quickly, you need to be ready to act.

	

	- 
	**Be Open to Negotiation**

	With **97 price adjustments**, sellers are showing they’re willing to negotiate. Don’t be afraid to make an offer on a home, even if it’s listed slightly above your budget. I always tell my clients: as long as your offer isn’t unreasonable, it’s worth submitting. You never know what the seller might accept or counter with.

	

	- 
	**Monitor Coming Soon Listings**

	Early access to listings is a game-changer in this market. With **9 coming soon homes**, you can get a head start on your competition. Let me keep you updated on these listings so you can be first in line for showings.

	

	- 
	**Consider Backup Offers**

	If the home you want is under contract, don’t walk away just yet. **31 properties are active under contract**, meaning backup offers are still being considered. By submitting a backup offer, you increase your chances of landing the home if the initial deal falls through.

	

	- 
	**Keep an Eye on Expired Listings**

	Expired listings present unique opportunities. If a home didn’t sell, it could be due to poor marketing, overpriced listing, or other factors. I can help you target these properties to see if they might be a good fit for your needs at a new price point.

	

### Tips for Santa Clarita Home Sellers

	- 
	**Price Strategically from the Start**

	One of the main reasons homes expire without selling is pricing. With **6 expired listings** this week, it’s clear that pricing is crucial. Work with a knowledgeable Realtor – like me – to ensure your home is priced competitively from day one. This will attract more buyers and increase your chances of a quick sale.

	

	- 
	**Make Necessary Adjustments**

	If your home isn’t selling, be open to making adjustments. This could mean a price reduction or simple cosmetic improvements to enhance curb appeal. With **97 price changes** in the last week, many sellers are finding success by adapting to the market.

	

	- 
	**Timing Is Everything**

	Sometimes, the best move is to cancel your listing and wait for better market conditions. **15 sellers canceled their listings** this week, and they may re-list when the time is right. I’ll help you evaluate the best time to sell based on your personal goals and the current market trends.
