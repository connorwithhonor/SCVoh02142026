# Santa Clarita Real Estate Market: Active Listings, Market Insights, and Expert Tips from Your First Responder Realtor

If you're looking to buy or sell a home in Santa Clarita, you're in the right place. As your First Responder Realtor, I take pride in keeping you informed about the latest real estate trends and opportunities in this dynamic market. Whether you’re hunting for a dream home or thinking of selling your current property, it's crucial to stay updated on the ever-changing landscape of Santa Clarita real estate.

### A Snapshot of the Santa Clarita Real Estate Market as of October 25, 2024

As of October 25th, 2024 – the 299th day of the year – the Santa Clarita real estate market is bustling with activity. Let’s get straight to the numbers:

### What Do These Numbers Mean for Santa Clarita Home Buyers?

If you're in the market for a new home, Santa Clarita offers a variety of opportunities. With **60 new listings** this week alone, you’ll find plenty of fresh options to explore. Whether you're searching for a cozy condo or a spacious family home, the inventory remains diverse, and there’s something for every type of buyer.

### What Do the Price Adjustments Indicate?

With **97 price changes** in the past week, it's clear that sellers are adjusting their expectations to align with the current market. This can be a major opportunity for buyers to negotiate better deals, especially if you've been watching a property that was initially priced out of your budget. A price adjustment could bring that dream home into your range.

### Coming Soon Listings: Get Ahead of the Curve

One of the best ways to secure a great deal in Santa Clarita is to act fast. With **9 coming soon listings**, buyers who stay connected with a knowledgeable realtor can gain early access to properties before they officially hit the market. These pre-market opportunities often give you a competitive edge, allowing you to see homes before the general public.

If you want access to these listings, reach out to me directly. I can help you navigate the coming soon properties and ensure you’re one of the first to tour them.

### Why Do Listings Fall Out of Contract?

We’ve seen **19 properties come back on the market** this week after initially going under contract. This could happen for a variety of reasons – financing falls through, inspection issues arise, or buyers get cold feet. For you, as a potential buyer, this means a second chance to secure a property that may have slipped through your fingers before. It's also an indicator that backup offers, which I highly recommend, are a strong strategy in a market like ours.

### Active Under Contract: What It Means for Buyers

When you see a property listed as **active under contract** – and we currently have **31 properties in this status** – it means an offer has been accepted, but the seller is still open to backup offers. If you’ve been eyeing a property that’s under contract, don’t give up. Submitting a backup offer could land you the home if the current deal falls through. It’s a smart move in a competitive market, and I’ve seen it work for many of my clients.

### What Do Pending Sales Tell Us?

**41 pending sales** are homes in the final stages before closing, meaning the market is moving. Pending sales give us a glimpse of what’s about to close, showing that buyers are making decisions and sellers are closing deals. If you’re in the market, this level of activity should give you confidence that the market is healthy and active. But don’t wait too long – competition is still strong, and well-priced homes are moving fast.

### For Home Sellers: Understanding Expired and Canceled Listings

If you're a seller and your home isn't moving, it’s crucial to understand why. This week, **6 listings expired** because they didn’t sell within the contract period. Expired listings often signal that the property was priced too high or didn’t receive the right marketing push. If you’re in this position, don’t get discouraged. A strategic price adjustment or a refreshed marketing strategy can help you get back on track.

Additionally, **15 sellers canceled their listings**, deciding now wasn’t the right time to sell. Canceled listings might come back later, often with new pricing or after sellers make improvements to the property. This is where timing and market conditions play a huge role. As your Realtor, I can help you evaluate when the right time to list your home is, so you avoid becoming an expired or canceled listing.

### Santa Clarita Real Estate Market Insights: The Big Picture

Santa Clarita is moving, and as your First Responder Realtor, I’m here to make sure you’re informed at every step. With a total of **555 active listings**, this market is ripe with opportunity for both buyers and sellers. But the key to success is staying sharp and knowing how to navigate these numbers.
